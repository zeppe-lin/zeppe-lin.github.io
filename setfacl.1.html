<p class="Pp">This utility sets Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and
    directories. On the command line, a sequence of commands is followed by a
    sequence of files (which in turn can be followed by another sequence of
    commands, ...).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>-m</i> and <i>-x</i> options expect an ACL on the command
    line. Multiple ACL entries are separated by comma characters (`,'). The
    <i>-M</i> and <i>-X</i> options read an ACL from a file or from standard
    input. The ACL entry format is described in Section ACL ENTRIES.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>--set</i> and <i>--set-file</i> options set the ACL of a
    file or a directory. The previous ACL is replaced. ACL entries for this
    operation must include permissions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>-m (--modify)</i> and <i>-M (--modify-file)</i> options
    modify the ACL of a file or directory. ACL entries for this operation must
    include permissions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>-x (--remove)</i> and <i>-X (--remove-file)</i> options
    remove ACL entries. It is not an error to remove an entry which does not
    exist. Only ACL entries without the <i>perms</i> field are accepted as
    parameters, unless POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">When reading from files using the <i>-M</i> and <i>-X</i> options,
    setfacl accepts the output getfacl produces. There is at most one ACL entry
    per line. After a Pound sign (`#'), everything up to the end of the line is
    treated as a comment.</p>
<p class="Pp">If setfacl is used on a file system which does not support ACLs,
    setfacl operates on the file mode permission bits. If the ACL does not fit
    completely in the permission bits, setfacl modifies the file mode permission
    bits to reflect the ACL as closely as possible, writes an error message to
    standard error, and returns with an exit status greater than 0.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="PERMISSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#PERMISSIONS">PERMISSIONS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The file owner and processes capable of CAP_FOWNER are granted the
    right to modify ACLs of a file. This is analogous to the permissions
    required for accessing the file mode. (On current Linux systems, root is the
    only user with the CAP_FOWNER capability.)</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="b,"><a class="permalink" href="#b,"><i>-b, --remove-all</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove all extended ACL entries. The base ACL entries of the owner, group
      and others are retained.</dd>
  <dt id="k,"><a class="permalink" href="#k,"><i>-k,
    --remove-default</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove the Default ACL. If no Default ACL exists, no warnings are
    issued.</dd>
  <dt id="n,"><a class="permalink" href="#n,"><i>-n, --no-mask</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not recalculate the effective rights mask. The default behavior of
      setfacl is to recalculate the ACL mask entry, unless a mask entry was
      explicitly given. The mask entry is set to the union of all permissions of
      the owning group, and all named user and group entries. (These are exactly
      the entries affected by the mask entry).</dd>
  <dt id="mask"><a class="permalink" href="#mask"><i>--mask</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Do recalculate the effective rights mask, even if an ACL mask entry was
      explicitly given. (See the <i>-n </i>option.)</dd>
  <dt id="d,"><a class="permalink" href="#d,"><i>-d, --default</i></a></dt>
  <dd>All operations apply to the Default ACL. Regular ACL entries in the input
      set are promoted to Default ACL entries. Default ACL entries in the input
      set are discarded. (A warning is issued if that happens).</dd>
  <dt id="restore=_file_-_"><a class="permalink" href="#restore=_file_-_"><i>--restore={file|-}</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Restore a permission backup created by `getfacl -R' or similar. All
      permissions of a complete directory subtree are restored using this
      mechanism. If the input contains owner comments or group comments, setfacl
      attempts to restore the owner and owning group. If the input contains
      flags comments (which define the setuid, setgid, and sticky bits), setfacl
      sets those three bits accordingly; otherwise, it clears them. This option
      cannot be mixed with other options except `--test'. If the file specified
      is '<b>-</b>', then it will be read from standard input.</dd>
  <dt id="test"><a class="permalink" href="#test"><i>--test</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Test mode. Instead of changing the ACLs of any files, the resulting ACLs
      are listed.</dd>
  <dt id="R,"><a class="permalink" href="#R,"><i>-R, --recursive</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Apply operations to all files and directories recursively. This option
      cannot be mixed with `--restore'.</dd>
  <dt id="L,"><a class="permalink" href="#L,"><i>-L, --logical</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Logical walk, follow symbolic links to directories. The default behavior
      is to follow symbolic link arguments, and skip symbolic links encountered
      in subdirectories. Only effective in combination with -R. This option
      cannot be mixed with `--restore'.</dd>
  <dt id="P,"><a class="permalink" href="#P,"><i>-P, --physical</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Physical walk, do not follow symbolic links to directories. This also
      skips symbolic link arguments. Only effective in combination with -R. This
      option cannot be mixed with `--restore'.</dd>
  <dt id="v,"><a class="permalink" href="#v,"><i>-v, --version</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the version of setfacl and exit.</dd>
  <dt id="h,"><a class="permalink" href="#h,"><i>-h, --help</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Print help explaining the command line options.</dd>
  <dt><i>--</i></dt>
  <dd>End of command line options. All remaining parameters are interpreted as
      file names, even if they start with a dash.</dd>
  <dt><i>-</i></dt>
  <dd>If the file name parameter is a single dash, setfacl reads a list of files
      from standard input.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ACL_ENTRIES"><a class="permalink" href="#ACL_ENTRIES">ACL
  ENTRIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The setfacl utility recognizes the following ACL entry formats
    (blanks inserted for clarity):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[d[efault]:] [u[ser]:]<i>uid </i>[:<i>perms</i>]</dt>
  <dd>Permissions of a named user. Permissions of the file owner if <i>uid</i>
      is empty.</dd>
  <dt>[d[efault]:] g[roup]:<i>gid </i>[:<i>perms</i>]</dt>
  <dd>Permissions of a named group. Permissions of the owning group if
      <i>gid</i> is empty.</dd>
  <dt>[d[efault]:] m[ask][:] [:<i>perms</i>]</dt>
  <dd>Effective rights mask</dd>
  <dt>[d[efault]:] o[ther][:] [:<i>perms</i>]</dt>
  <dd>Permissions of others.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Whitespace between delimiter characters and non-delimiter
    characters is ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Proper ACL entries including permissions are used in modify and
    set operations. (options <i>-m</i>, <i>-M</i>, <i>--set</i> and
    <i>--set-file</i>). Entries without the <i>perms</i> field are used for
    <i>deletion</i> of entries (options <i>-x</i> and <i>-X</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">For <i>uid</i> and <i>gid</i> you can specify either a name or a
    number. Character literals may be specified with a backslash followed by the
    3-digit octal digits corresponding to the ASCII code for the character
    (e.g., <i>\101</i> for 'A'). If the name contains a literal backslash
    followed by 3 digits, the backslash must be escaped (i.e., <i>\\</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>perms</i> field is a combination of characters that
    indicate the read <i>(r)</i>, write <i>(w)</i>, execute <i>(x)</i>
    permissions. Dash characters in the <i>perms</i> field <i>(-)</i> are
    ignored. The character <i>X</i> stands for the execute permission if the
    file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user.
    Alternatively, the <i>perms</i> field can define the permissions
    numerically, as a bit-wise combination of read <i>(4)</i>, write <i>(2)</i>,
    and execute <i>(1)</i>. Zero <i>perms</i> fields or <i>perms</i> fields that
    only consist of dashes indicate no permissions.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="AUTOMATICALLY_CREATED_ENTRIES"><a class="permalink" href="#AUTOMATICALLY_CREATED_ENTRIES">AUTOMATICALLY
  CREATED ENTRIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Initially, files and directories contain only the three base ACL
    entries for the owner, the group, and others. There are some rules that need
    to be satisfied in order for an ACL to be valid:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The three base entries cannot be removed. There must be exactly one entry
      of each of these base entry types.</li>
  <li>Whenever an ACL contains named user entries or named group objects, it
      must also contain an effective rights mask.</li>
  <li>Whenever an ACL contains any Default ACL entries, the three Default ACL
      base entries (default owner, default group, and default others) must also
      exist.</li>
  <li>Whenever a Default ACL contains named user entries or named group objects,
      it must also contain a default effective rights mask.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">To help the user ensure these rules, setfacl creates entries from
    existing entries under the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If an ACL contains named user or named group entries, and no mask entry
      exists, a mask entry containing the same permissions as the group entry is
      created. Unless the <i>-n</i> option is given, the permissions of the mask
      entry are further adjusted to include the union of all permissions
      affected by the mask entry. (See the <i>-n</i> option description).</li>
  <li>If a Default ACL entry is created, and the Default ACL contains no owner,
      owning group, or others entry, a copy of the ACL owner, owning group, or
      others entry is added to the Default ACL.</li>
  <li>If a Default ACL contains named user entries or named group entries, and
      no mask entry exists, a mask entry containing the same permissions as the
      default Default ACL's group entry is added. Unless the <i>-n</i> option is
      given, the permissions of the mask entry are further adjusted to include
      the union of all permissions affected by the mask entry. (See the
      <i>-n</i> option description).</li>
