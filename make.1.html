<p class="Pp">The <i>make</i> utility will determine automatically which pieces
    of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to
    recompile them. The manual describes the GNU implementation of <b>make</b>,
    which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently
    maintained by Paul Smith. Our examples show C programs, since they are very
    common, but you can use <b>make</b> with any programming language whose
    compiler can be run with a shell command. In fact, <b>make</b> is not
    limited to programs. You can use it to describe any task where some files
    must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.</p>
<p class="Pp">To prepare to use <b>make</b>, you must write a file called the
    <i>makefile</i> that describes the relationships among files in your
    program, and provides commands for updating each file. In a program,
    typically the executable file is updated from object files, which are in
    turn made by compiling source files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source
    files, this simple shell command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>make</b></div>
<p class="Pp">suffices to perform all necessary recompilations. The <b>make</b>
    program uses the makefile description and the last-modification times of the
    files to decide which of the files need to be updated. For each of those
    files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>make</b> executes commands in the <i>makefile</i> to update one
    or more <i>targets</i>, where <i>target</i> is typically a program. If no
    <b>-f</b> option is present, <b>make</b> will look for the makefiles
    <i>GNUmakefile</i>, <i>makefile</i>, and <i>Makefile</i>, in that order.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally you should call your makefile either <i>makefile</i> or
    <i>Makefile</i>. (We recommend <i>Makefile</i> because it appears
    prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other
    important files such as <i>README</i>.) The first name checked,
    <i>GNUmakefile</i>, is not recommended for most makefiles. You should use
    this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU Make, and will not
    be understood by other versions of <b>make</b>. If <i>makefile</i> is '-',
    the standard input is read.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>make</b> updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files
    that have been modified since the target was last modified, or if the target
    does not exist.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><b>-b</b>, <b>-m</b></a></dt>
  <dd>These options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of
      <b>make</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="B"><a class="permalink" href="#B"><b>-B</b>,
    <b>--always-make</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Unconditionally make all targets.</dd>
  <dt id="C"><a class="permalink" href="#C"><b>-C</b> <i>dir</i>,
    <b>--directory</b>=<i>dir</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Change to directory <i>dir</i> before reading the makefiles or doing
      anything else. If multiple <b>-C</b> options are specified, each is
      interpreted relative to the previous one: <b>-C </b>/ <b>-C </b>etc is
      equivalent to <b>-C </b>/etc. This is typically used with recursive
      invocations of <b>make</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>-d</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print debugging information in addition to normal processing. The
      debugging information says which files are being considered for remaking,
      which file-times are being compared and with what results, which files
      actually need to be remade, which implicit rules are considered and which
      are applied---everything interesting about how <b>make</b> decides what to
      do.</dd>
  <dt id="debug"><a class="permalink" href="#debug"><b>--debug</b><i>[=FLAGS]</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Print debugging information in addition to normal processing. If the
      <i>FLAGS</i> are omitted, then the behavior is the same as if <b>-d</b>
      was specified. <i>FLAGS</i> may be any or all of the following names,
      comma- or space-separated. Only the first character is significant: the
      rest may be omitted: <i>all</i> for all debugging output (same as using
      <b>-d</b>), <i>basic</i> for basic debugging, <i>verbose</i> for more
      verbose basic debugging, <i>implicit</i> for showing implicit rule search
      operations, <i>jobs</i> for details on invocation of commands,
      <i>makefile</i> for debugging while remaking makefiles, <i>print</i> shows
      all recipes that are run even if they are silent, and <i>why</i> shows the
      reason <b>make</b> decided to rebuild each target. Use <i>none</i> to
      disable all previous debugging flags.</dd>
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><b>-e</b>,
    <b>--environment-overrides</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Give variables taken from the environment precedence over variables from
      makefiles.</dd>
  <dt id="E"><a class="permalink" href="#E"><b>-E</b> <i>string</i>,
    <b>--eval</b> <i>string</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Interpret <i>string</i> using the <b>eval</b> function, before parsing any
      makefiles.</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><b>-f</b> <i>file</i>,
    <b>--file</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--makefile</b>=<i>FILE</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Use <i>file</i> as a makefile.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b>,
    <b>--ignore-errors</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files.</dd>
  <dt id="I"><a class="permalink" href="#I"><b>-I</b> <i>dir</i>,
    <b>--include-dir</b>=<i>dir</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a directory <i>dir</i> to search for included makefiles. If
      several <b>-I</b> options are used to specify several directories, the
      directories are searched in the order specified. Unlike the arguments to
      other flags of <b>make</b>, directories given with <b>-I</b> flags may
      come directly after the flag: <b>-I</b><i>dir</i> is allowed, as well as
      <b>-I</b> <i>dir</i>. This syntax is allowed for compatibility with the C
      preprocessor's <b>-I</b> flag.</dd>
  <dt id="j"><a class="permalink" href="#j"><b>-j</b> [<i>jobs</i>],
    <b>--jobs</b>[=<i>jobs</i>]</a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the number of <i>jobs</i> (commands) to run simultaneously. If
      there is more than one <b>-j</b> option, the last one is effective. If the
      <b>-j</b> option is given without an argument, <b>make</b> will not limit
      the number of jobs that can run simultaneously.</dd>
  <dt id="jobserver_style="><a class="permalink" href="#jobserver_style="><b>--jobserver-style=</b><i>style</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The style of jobserver to use. The <i>style</i> may be one of <b>fifo</b>,
      <b>pipe</b>, or <b>sem</b> (Windows only).</dd>
  <dt id="k"><a class="permalink" href="#k"><b>-k</b>,
    <b>--keep-going</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Continue as much as possible after an error. While the target that failed,
      and those that depend on it, cannot be remade, the other dependencies of
      these targets can be processed all the same.</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><b>-l</b> [<i>load</i>],
    <b>--load-average</b>[=<i>load</i>]</a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are
      others jobs running and the load average is at least <i>load</i> (a
      floating-point number). With no argument, removes a previous load
    limit.</dd>
  <dt id="L"><a class="permalink" href="#L"><b>-L</b>,
    <b>--check-symlink-times</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><b>-n</b>, <b>--just-print</b>,
    <b>--dry-run</b>, <b>--recon</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them (except
      in certain circumstances).</dd>
  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o"><b>-o</b> <i>file</i>,
    <b>--old-file</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--assume-old</b>=<i>file</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not remake the file <i>file</i> even if it is older than its
      dependencies, and do not remake anything on account of changes in
      <i>file</i>. Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules are
      ignored.</dd>
  <dt id="O"><a class="permalink" href="#O"><b>-O</b>[<i>type</i>],
    <b>--output-sync</b>[=<i>type</i>]</a></dt>
  <dd>When running multiple jobs in parallel with <b>-j</b>, ensure the output
      of each job is collected together rather than interspersed with output
      from other jobs. If <i>type</i> is not specified or is <b>target</b> the
      output from the entire recipe for each target is grouped together. If
      <i>type</i> is <b>line</b> the output from each command line within a
      recipe is grouped together. If <i>type</i> is <b>recurse</b> output from
      an entire recursive make is grouped together. If <i>type</i> is
      <b>none</b> output synchronization is disabled.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><b>-p</b>,
    <b>--print-data-base</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results from reading
      the makefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise specified. This also
      prints the version information given by the <b>-v</b> switch (see below).
      To print the data base without trying to remake any files, use <i>make -p
      -f/dev/null</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><b>-q</b>,
    <b>--question</b></a></dt>
  <dd>``Question mode''. Do not run any commands, or print anything; just return
      an exit status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to
      date, nonzero otherwise.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b>,
    <b>--no-builtin-rules</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Eliminate use of the built-in implicit rules. Also clear out the default
      list of suffixes for suffix rules.</dd>
  <dt id="R"><a class="permalink" href="#R"><b>-R</b>,
    <b>--no-builtin-variables</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Don't define any built-in variables.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>,
    <b>--quiet</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.</dd>
  <dt id="no"><a class="permalink" href="#no"><b>--no-silent</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Cancel the effect of the <b>-s</b> option.</dd>
  <dt id="S"><a class="permalink" href="#S"><b>-S</b>, <b>--no-keep-going</b>,
    <b>--stop</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Cancel the effect of the <b>-k</b> option.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><b>-t</b>, <b>--touch</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them) instead of
      running their commands. This is used to pretend that the commands were
      done, in order to fool future invocations of <b>make</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="trace"><a class="permalink" href="#trace"><b>--trace</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Information about the disposition of each target is printed (why the
      target is being rebuilt and what commands are run to rebuild it).</dd>
  <dt id="v"><a class="permalink" href="#v"><b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the version of the <b>make</b> program plus a copyright, a list of
      authors and a notice that there is no warranty.</dd>
  <dt id="w"><a class="permalink" href="#w"><b>-w</b>,
    <b>--print-directory</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print a message containing the working directory before and after other
      processing. This may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated
      nests of recursive <b>make</b> commands.</dd>
  <dt id="no~2"><a class="permalink" href="#no~2"><b>--no-print-directory</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn off <b>-w</b>, even if it was turned on implicitly.</dd>
  <dt id="shuffle"><a class="permalink" href="#shuffle"><b>--shuffle</b><i>[=MODE]</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Enable shuffling of goal and prerequisite ordering. <i>MODE</i> is one of
      <i>none</i> to disable shuffle mode, <i>random</i> to shuffle
      prerequisites in random order, <i>reverse</i> to consider prerequisites in
      reverse order, or an integer <i>&lt;seed&gt;</i> which enables
      <i>random</i> mode with a specific <i>seed</i> value. If <i>MODE</i> is
      omitted the default is <i>random</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="W"><a class="permalink" href="#W"><b>-W</b> <i>file</i>,
    <b>--what-if</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--new-file</b>=<i>file</i>,
    <b>--assume-new</b>=<i>file</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Pretend that the target <i>file</i> has just been modified. When used with
      the <b>-n</b> flag, this shows you what would happen if you were to modify
      that file. Without <b>-n</b>, it is almost the same as running a
      <i>touch</i> command on the given file before running <b>make</b>, except
      that the modification time is changed only in the imagination of
      <b>make</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="warn"><a class="permalink" href="#warn"><b>--warn-undefined-variables</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.</dd>
