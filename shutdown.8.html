<p class="Pp"><b>shutdown</b> brings the system down in a secure way. All
    logged-in users are notified that the system is going down, and
    <b>login</b>(1) is blocked. It is possible to shut the system down
    immediately or after a specified delay. All processes are first notified
    that the system is going down by the signal <b>SIGTERM</b>. This gives
    programs like <b>vi</b>(1) the time to save the file being edited, mail and
    news processing programs a chance to exit cleanly, etc. <b>shutdown</b> does
    its job by signalling the <b>init</b> process, asking it to change the
    runlevel. Runlevel <b>0</b> is used to halt the system, runlevel <b>6</b> is
    used to reboot the system, and runlevel <b>1</b> is used to put to system
    into a state where administrative tasks can be performed; this is the
    default if neither the <b>-h</b> or <b>-r</b> flag is given to
    <b>shutdown</b>. To see which actions are taken on halt or reboot see the
    appropriate entries for these runlevels in the file <i>/etc/inittab</i>.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>-a</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Use <i>/etc/shutdown.allow</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="k"><a class="permalink" href="#k"><b>-k</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Don't really shutdown; only send the warning messages to everybody.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Reboot after shutdown.</dd>
  <dt id="h"><a class="permalink" href="#h"><b>-h</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Halt or power off after shutdown. Usually used with the <b>-P</b> or
      <b>-H</b> flags, depending on whether we want to poweroff or simply stop
      the operating system.</dd>
  <dt id="P"><a class="permalink" href="#P"><b>-P</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Modifier to the <b>-h</b> flag. Halt action is to turn off the power. Must
      be used with the <b>-h</b> flag.</dd>
  <dt id="H"><a class="permalink" href="#H"><b>-H</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Modifier to the <b>-h</b> flag. Halt action is to halt or drop into boot
      monitor on systems that support it. Must be used with the <b>-h</b> flag.
      Halting is often used to run through the shutdown process and leave output
      on the screen for debugging purposes. Or when the user wants the OS to
      stop, but leave the power on. To power off at the end of the shutdown
      sequence use the <b>-P</b> modifier instead.</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><b>-f</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Skip <b>fsck</b>(8) on reboot.</dd>
  <dt id="F"><a class="permalink" href="#F"><b>-F</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Force <b>fsck</b>(8) on reboot.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><b>-n</b></a></dt>
  <dd>[DEPRECATED] Don't call <b>init</b>(8) to do the shutdown but do it
      ourself. The use of this option is discouraged, and its results are not
      always what you'd expect.</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>-c</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Cancel a waiting shutdown. (<b>shutdown now</b> is no longer waiting.)
      With this option it is of course not possible to give the time argument,
      but you can enter explanatory message arguments on the command line that
      will be sent to all users.</dd>
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><b>-q</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Reduce the number of warnings <b>shutdown</b> displays. Usually
      <b>shutdown</b> displays warnings every 15 minutes and then every minute
      in the last 10 minutes of the countdown until <i>time</i> is reached. When
      <b>-q</b> is specified <b>shutdown</b> only warns at 60 minute intervals,
      at the 10 minute mark, at the 5 minute mark, and when the shutdown process
      actually happens.</dd>
  <dt id="Q"><a class="permalink" href="#Q"><b>-Q</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Silence warnings prior to shutting down. Usually <b>shutdown</b> displays
      warnings every 15 minutes and then every minute in the last 10 minutes of
      the countdown until <i>time</i> is reached. When <b>-Q</b> is specified
      <b>shutdown</b> only warns when the shutdown process actually happens. All
      other warning intervals are suppressed.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><b>-t</b> <i>sec</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Tell <b>init</b>(8) to wait <i>sec</i> seconds between sending all
      processes the warning (<b>SIGTERM</b>) and the kill signal
      (<b>SIGKILL</b>), before changing to another runlevel. The default time,
      if no value is specified, between these two signals is three seconds.
      Warning: when <b>shutdown</b> calls <b>init</b>(8) to perform the shutdown
      (the default behavior), <b>init</b>(8) checks to see if all processes have
      terminated and will stop waiting early once its children have all
      terminated. When <b>shutdown</b> is called with the <b>-n</b> flag, it
      waits the full time specified (or three seconds) even if all other
      processes have terminated.</dd>
  <dt id="time"><a class="permalink" href="#time"><i>time</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When to shutdown.</dd>
  <dt id="warning"><a class="permalink" href="#warning"><i>warning
    message</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Message to send to all users.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <i>time</i> argument can have different formats. First, it can
    be an absolute time in the format <i>hh:mm</i>, in which <i>hh</i> is the
    hour (1 or 2 digits) and <i>mm</i> is the minute of the hour (in two
    digits). Second, it can be in the format <b>+</b><i>m</i>, in which <i>m</i>
    is the number of minutes to wait. Third, it can be in the format
    <b>+</b><i>hh:mm</i>, in which <i>hh:mm</i> is the number of hours and
    minutes to wait. The word <b>now</b> is an alias for <b>+0</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>shutdown</b> is called with a delay, it will create the
    advisory file <i>/etc/nologin</i> which causes programs such as
    <b>login</b>(1) to not allow new user logins. This file is created five
    minutes before the shutdown sequence starts. <b>shutdown</b> removes this
    file if it is stopped before it can signal init (i.e., it is cancelled or
    something goes wrong). It also removes it before calling <b>init</b>(8) to
    change the runlevel.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-f</b> flag means `reboot fast'. This only creates an
    advisory file <i>/fastboot</i> which can be tested by the system when it
    comes up again. The boot rc file can test if this file is present, and
    decide not to run <b>fsck</b>(8) since the system has been shut down in the
    proper way. After that, the boot process should remove <i>/fastboot</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-F</b> flag means `force fsck'. This only creates an
    advisory file <i>/forcefsck</i> which can be tested by the system when it
    comes up again. The boot rc file can test if this file is present, and
    decide to run <b>fsck</b>(8) with a special `force' flag so that even
    properly unmounted file systems get checked. After that, the boot process
    should remove <i>/forcefsck</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-n</b> flag causes <b>shutdown</b> not to call
    <b>init</b>(8), but to kill all running processes itself. <b>shutdown</b>
    will then turn off quota, accounting, and swapping and unmount all file
    systems.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ACCESS_CONTROL"><a class="permalink" href="#ACCESS_CONTROL">ACCESS
  CONTROL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>shutdown</b> can be called from <b>init</b>(8) when the magic
    keys <b>CTRL-ALT-DEL</b> are pressed, by creating an appropriate entry in
    <i>/etc/inittab</i>. This means that everyone who has physical access to the
    console keyboard can shut the system down. To prevent this, <b>shutdown</b>
    can check to see if an authorized user is logged in on one of the virtual
    consoles. If <b>shutdown</b> is called with the <b>-a</b> argument (add this
    to the invocation of shutdown in <i>/etc/inittab</i>), it checks to see if
    the file <i>/etc/shutdown.allow</i> is present. It then compares the login
    names in that file with the list of people that are logged in on a virtual
    console (from <i>/var/run/utmp</i>). Only if one of those authorized users
    <b>or root</b> is logged in, it will proceed. Otherwise it will write the
    message</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre><b>shutdown: no authorized users logged in</b></pre>
<p class="Pp">to the (physical) system console. The format of
    <i>/etc/shutdown.allow</i> is one user name per line. Empty lines and
    comment lines (prefixed by a <b>#</b>) are allowed. Currently there is a
    limit of 32 users in this file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if <i>/etc/shutdown.allow</i> is not present, the
    <b>-a</b> argument is ignored.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HALT_OR_POWEROFF"><a class="permalink" href="#HALT_OR_POWEROFF">HALT
  OR POWEROFF</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-H</b> option just sets the <b>init</b> environment
    variable <b>INIT_HALT</b> to <b>HALT</b>, and the <b>-P</b> option just sets
    that variable to <b>POWEROFF</b>. The script (usually
    <i>/etc/init.d/halt</i>) that calls the <b>halt</b>(8) program as the last
    thing in the shutting down sequence should check this environment variable
    and call the <b>halt</b>(8) program with the right options for these options
    to actually have any effect.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A lot of users forget to give the <i>time</i> argument and are
    then puzzled by the error message <b>shutdown</b> produces. The <i>time</i>
    argument is mandatory; in 90 percent of all cases this argument will be the
    word <b>now</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>init</b>(8) can only capture CTRL-ALT-DEL and start
    <b>shutdown</b> in console mode. If the system is running the X window
    System, the X server processes all key strokes. Some X11 environments make
    it possible to capture CTRL-ALT-DEL, but what exactly is done with that
    event depends on that environment.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>shutdown</b> wasn't designed to be run setuid.
    <i>/etc/shutdown.allow</i> is not used to find out who is executing
    shutdown, it ONLY checks who is currently logged in on (one of the)
    console(s).</p>
