      Some mail handlers (like msmtp) can't route mail to local users. If that's
      what you're using, then you should supply a remote address using this
      switch. Cron output for all users will be directed to that address.
      Alternatively, you could supply a different mail handler using the -M
      switch, to log or otherwise process the messages instead of mailing them.
      Alternatively, you could just direct the stdout and stderr of your cron
      jobs to /dev/null.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>crond</b> is responsible for scanning the crontab files and
    running their commands at the appropriate time. It always synchronizes to
    the top of the minute, matching the current time against its internal list
    of parsed crontabs. That list is stored so that it can be scanned very
    quickly, and <b>crond</b> can deal with several hundred crontabs with
    several thousand entries without using noticeable CPU.</p>
<p class="Pp">Cron jobs are not re-executed if a previous instance of them is
    still running. For example, if you have a crontab command
    sleep&#x00A0;70<b>, that</b> <b>you request to be run every minute,
    </b><b>crond</b><b> will skip this</b> <b>job when it sees it is still
    running.</b> <b>So the job won't be run more frequently than once every
    two</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>If you do not like this feature, you can run your
    commands in the</b> <b>background with an &amp;</b><b>.</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>crond</b> automatically detects when the clock has been
    changed, during its per-minute scans. Backwards time-changes of an hour or
    less won't re-run cron jobs from the intervening period. <b>crond</b> will
    effectively sleep until it catches back up to the original time. Forwards
    time-changes of an hour or less (or if the computer is suspended and resumed
    again within an hour) will run any missed jobs exactly once. Changes greater
    than an hour in either direction cause <b>crond</b> to re-calculate when
    jobs should be run, and not attempt to execute any missed commands. This is
    effectively the same as if <b>crond</b> had been stopped and re-started.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose it's 10 am, and a job is scheduled to run
    every day at 10:30 am. If you set the system's clock forward to 11 am, crond
    will immediately run the 10:30 job. If on the other hand you set the
    system's clock forward to noon, the 10:30 am job will be skipped until the
    next day. Jobs scheduled using @daily and the like work differently; see
    crontab(1) for details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>crond</b> has a number of built in limitations to reduce the
    chance of it being ill-used. Potentially infinite loops during parsing are
    dealt with via a failsafe counter, and non-root crontabs are limited to 256
    crontab entries. Crontab lines may not be longer than 1024 characters,
    including the newline.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever <b>crond</b> must run a job, it first creates a
    daemon-owned temporary file O_EXCL and O_APPEND to store any output, then
    fork()s and changes its user and group permissions to match that of the user
    the job is being run for, then <b>exec</b>s <b>/bin/sh -c </b> to run the
    job. The temporary file remains under the ownership of the daemon to prevent
    the user from tampering with it. Upon job completion, <b>crond</b> verifies
    the secureness of the mail file and, if it has been appended to, mails the
    file to the specified address. The <b>sendmail</b> program (or custom mail
    handler, if supplied) is run under the user's uid to prevent mail related
    security holes.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a user edits their crontab, <b>crontab</b> first copies the
    crontab to a user owned file before running the user's preferred editor. The
    suid <b>crontab</b> keeps an open descriptor to the file which it later uses
    to copy the file back, thereby ensuring the user has not tampered with the
    file type.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>crontab</b> notifies <b>crond</b> that a user's crontab file
    has been modified (or created or deleted) through the
    &#x201C;cron.update&#x201D; file, which resides in the per-user crontabs
    directory (usually /var/spool/cron/crontabs). <b>crontab</b> appends the
    filename of the modified crontab file to &#x201C;cron.update&#x201D;; and
    <b>crond</b> inspects this file to determine when to reparse or otherwise
    update its internal list of parsed crontabs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever a &#x201C;cron.update&#x201D; file is seen, <b>crond</b>
    also re-reads timestamp files from its timestamp directory (usually
    /var/spool/cron/cronstamps). Normally these will just mirror <b>crond</b>'s
    own internal representations, but this mechanism could be used to manually
    notify <b>crond</b> that you've externally updated the timestamps.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &#x201C;cron.update&#x201D; file can also be used to ask
    <b>crond</b> to schedule a &#x201C;named&#x201D; cron job. To do this,
    append a line of the form:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
clio&#x00A0;job1&#x00A0;!job2
<b></b></pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">to &#x201C;cron.update&#x201D;. This request that user clio's job1
    should be scheduled (waiting first for the successful completion of any jobs
    named in job1's AFTER= tag), and job2 should also be scheduled (without
    waiting for other jobs). See crontab(1) for more about tags and named
  jobs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The directory of per-user crontabs is re-parsed once every hour in
    any case. Any crontabs in the system directory (usually /etc/cron.d) are
    parsed at the same time. This directory can be used by packaging systems.
    When you install a package foo, it might write its own foo-specific crontab
    to /etc/cron.d/foo.</p>
<p class="Pp">The superuser has a per-user crontab along with other users. It
    usually resides at /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users can only have a crontab if they have an entry in
    /etc/passwd; however they do not need to have login shell privileges. Cron
    jobs are always run under /bin/sh; see crontab(1) for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike <b>crontab</b>, the <b>crond</b> program does not keep open
    descriptors to crontab files while running their jobs, as this could cause
    <b>crond</b> to run out of descriptors.</p>
