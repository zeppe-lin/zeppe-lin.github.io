# Zeppe-Lin Linux

**Minimal. Source-based. Built to be understood.**

Zeppe-Lin is a GNU/Linux distribution for x86-64 systems, forked from
CRUX and forged in the spirit of KISS — *Keep It Simple, Stupid*.
It’s not a distro for everyone.  It’s for those who want to build
their system from the ground up, with clarity over abstraction and
control over convenience.

**You compile. You configure. You own it.**

Zeppe-Lin gives you the tools to shape your system, optimize it, and
understand.  No layers.  No hand-holding.  Just raw, deliberate Linux.

## Latest Release: v1.1

> **Built in the dark, ready to shine on your rig.**
> Featuring *Stine Luft Satomi* — our fictional hacker muse — this
> release tightens the screws and sharpens the edge.

Highlights:

* **Toolchain updated for kernel 6.1+**:
  A crucial update that ensures modern compatibility and stability,
  enabling new features like fs-verity.

* **New Documentation**:
  Rewritten [Handbook](handbook.html) from scratch, and new
  [Codebook](codebook.html) for devs (**WIP**).

* **Community Infrastructure**:
  New mailing lists on [FreeLists.org](https://www.freelists.org/) for
  support and dev chatter.  Thank you, **FreeLists.org**.
