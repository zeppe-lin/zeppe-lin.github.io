# Introduction

**Ghosts in the Rig.**
This release is a deep-tissue rebuild.
We spent this cycle hunting the ghosts - those silent drifts in the
toolchain and structural cracks that haunt a system as it grows.
We didn't wait for perfection; we stayed up late, tightened the
toolchain, and re-aligned every interface from the base code to the
documentation.
The result is a rig that is predictable, raw, and ready to be pushed.

The cover is the vibe: a crew caught in the static, fully aware of the
"cool lie" of being totally ready.
**v1.2** is readiness without the bullshit.
We're closing the chapter of pure defiance and starting the one where
we take meticulous care of the craft.
We know the ghosts are still in the wiring, but we've learned how to
fly with them.
**The system is ready because we made it ready.**
The launch is real.
**Pretend this is dramatic!**

# Incompatible Changes

**Read this before upgrading.**
Several updates change file ownerships, configuration layouts, or
introduce ABI bumps that require attention.

- **rc / log files** - `rc` now ships `/var/log/dmesg` and related
  `logrotate` entries.
  On upgrade, `pkgadd` may refuse to overwrite existing files unless
  forced.
  If you see errors when updating `rc`, run:

  ```sh
  # as root
  pkgman update -f rc
  ```

- **Run rejmerge** after upgrades that touch `/etc` (notably crontab
  and logrotate) to merge new configuration files into your system.

- **Install `run-one`, `run-parts` and `logrotate`** - required for
  consistent cron job execution and log rotation across services.

- **OpenSSL ABI bump** - OpenSSL moved to 3.5.4.
  Dependent packages were relbumped; local binaries built against
  older OpenSSL may need rebuilding (OpenSSH is a common example).

- **Cron scripts** - some packages fixed cron scripts that lacked a
  shebang (e.g., `man-db`); ensure `rejmerge` is run so updated
  scripts replace older copies.

## What's New

### Highlights

- Rebuilt structure - directory layout and package metadata normalized
  for predictable builds and clearer package behavior.

- Toolchain alignment - compilers, linkers, and build flags
  standardized across core packages to reduce subtle ABI and
  build-time differences.

- Logging and rotation - `logrotate` introduced as the system log
  rotation tool; per-service configs added (syslog, boot, dmesg).

- Cron and maintenance - switched to `run-parts` for scheduled jobs;
  removed legacy wrappers and updated crontab entries.

- Security and relbumps - security updates and relbumps across the
  tree (`openssl`, `util-linux`, `libarchive`, etc.).

- Reproducibility - improved build logs and deterministic packaging
  where feasible; signed release artifacts and checksums provided.

- New/imported packages - several small utilities and dependencies
  imported to support the above changes (e.g., `run-parts`, `run-one`,
  `popt`).
