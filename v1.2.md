# Introduction

**Ghosts in the Rig.**

v1.2 is a sanitization and structural maintenance release.
Following the toolchain alignment introduced in
[v1.1](v1.1.html), this cycle focused on system hygiene:
formalizing the logging stack, migrating manual pages to `scdoc`,
correcting ABI drifts across the pkgsrc collections, and tightening
package sources.

The goal remains unchanged: a transparent and predictable system where
nothing stays hidden.
Complexity is a tax; this release lowers it through structural
correction.

Ghosts remain in the wiring, but the rig is ready.

# Upgrade & Compatibility

**Breaking changes affect upgrades only; fresh installations are
unaffected.**

## Patch Updates (v1.2.1)

After the initial v1.2 release, a small set of maintenance and
security updates was applied within the same release line.

- Security fixes (notably `curl`)
- Upstream micro version updates (`sqlite3`, `libarchive`, `less`)
- Packaging cleanups
- System identity refresh (`/etc/os-release`, `/etc/issue`)

These changes do **not** alter the v1.2 architecture, interfaces, or
operational model.

For existing installations:

```sh
# as root
pkgman sysup --deps --depsort
rejmerge
```

is sufficient to reach the latest v1.2 state.

Fresh root filesystem and binary packages were refreshed to reflect
these updates.

> **Note:**
>
> Patch updates apply only to `pkgsrc-core`.
> Other collections (`pkgsrc-system`, `pkgsrc-xorg`, `pkgsrc-desktop`)
> remain unchanged at v1.2.

## OpenSSL 3.5.4 ABI Bump

OpenSSL is now at version 3.5.4.
This is an ABI change.

All package sources in the official collections have been relbumped
against the new version.
Locally compiled or third-party binaries built against v1.1 will no
longer link and must be rebuilt after upgrade.

## rc File Ownership Changes

The `rc` package now owns `/var/log/dmesg` and installs standard
`logrotate` configuration file.

During upgrade, `pkgadd(8)` may refuse to overwrite existing files due
ownership changes.
In this case, update the package forcibly:

```sh
# as root
pkgman update -f rc
```

This resolves the conflict and installs the new layout.

## Cron Execution Model

Scheduled job execution has been standardized on `run-parts`.
The legacy `runjobs` script from `dcron` has been removed
(see [GH #3](https://github.com/zeppe-lin/pkgsrc-core/issues/3)).

Install the required tools:

```sh
# as root
pkgman install --deps --group run-parts run-one
```

System cron entries have been updated accordingly.
Custom scripts under `/etc/cron/*` must be executable and compatible
with `run-parts`.
Scripts relying on `runjobs` should be adjusted.

Updated system configuration files will be merged via `rejmerge`.

## Log Rotation

Log rotation is now handled by `logrotate`.
Configuration files are installed under `/etc/logrotate.d`.

The legacy `rotatelog` script previously provided by `sysklogd` has
been removed
(see [GH #4](https://github.com/zeppe-lin/pkgsrc-core/issues/4)).
Log archival behaviour is unchanged: rotated logs are stored under
`/var/log/old`, just compressed.

Daily rotation jobs are scheduled via `dcron`.

Run `rejmerge` after completing the system upgrade to apply the
updated configuration.

## Binary Upgrade Option

For maintainers who prefer
[the path of least resistance](handbook.html#binary-upgrade),
binary packages ([`binpkgs`](#binary-packages)) are provided.
These are pre-built archives of the entire `pkgsrc-core` collection,
providing a direct binary path to the v1.2 state without local
compilation.

Using binary packages avoids local rebuilds but does not remove the
need to merge updated configuration files.

After installation, run `rejmerge` to complete the upgrade.

> Binary packages are a statistical convenience.
> They reduce variance, but they do not collapse uncertainty.
> Errors remain entangled with your system, waiting for observation.
> To build is to measure; to rebuild is to alter the wavefunction.
> Statistically speaking, you will fail --- and in failing, you will
> learn.

# What's New

### Infrastructure

The project website has its official domain:  
<https://zeppe-lin.org/>.

The website was redesigned, serving documentation and project
materials.

### Documentation

Manual pages have been fully migrated to `scdoc`.
Coverage across Zeppe-Lin tools has been expanded and normalized.

### Highlights

Logging standardized using `logrotate`.

Cron execution is unified under `run-parts`, with `run-one` introduced
for simpler job control.

New utility packages have been imported to support these changes,
including `run-parts`, `run-one`, and `popt`.

The [Handbook](handbook.html) has been updated to reflect the new cron
execution model.
