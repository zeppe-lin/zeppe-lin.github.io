<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> is an <b>sh</b>-compatible command language
    interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a
    file. <b>Bash</b> also incorporates useful features from the <i>Korn</i> and
    <i>C</i> shells (<b>ksh</b> and <b>csh</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> is intended to be a conformant implementation of the
    Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard
    1003.1). <b>Bash</b> can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by
  default.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">All of the single-character shell options documented in the
    description of the <b>set</b> builtin command, including <b>-o</b>, can be
    used as options when the shell is invoked. In addition, <b>bash</b>
    interprets the following options when it is invoked:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>-c</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-c</b> option is present, then commands are read from the first
      non-option argument <i>command_string</i>. If there are arguments after
      the <i>command_string</i>, the first argument is assigned to <b>$0</b> and
      any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters. The
      assignment to <b>$0</b> sets the name of the shell, which is used in
      warning and error messages.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-i</b> option is present, the shell is <i>interactive</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><b>-l</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Make <b>bash</b> act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see
      <small><b>INVOCATION</b></small> below).</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-r</b> option is present, the shell becomes <i>restricted</i>
      (see <small><b>RESTRICTED SHELL</b></small> below).</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-s</b> option is present, or if no arguments remain after option
      processing, then commands are read from the standard input. This option
      allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive
      shell or when reading input through a pipe.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>-D</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by <b>$</b> is printed on the
      standard output. These are the strings that are subject to language
      translation when the current locale is not <b>C</b> or <b>POSIX</b>. This
      implies the <b>-n</b> option; no commands will be executed.</dd>
  <dt><b>[-+]O [<i>shopt_option</i>]</b></dt>
  <dd><i>shopt_option</i> is one of the shell options accepted by the
      <b>shopt</b> builtin (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small>
      below). If <i>shopt_option</i> is present, <b>-O</b> sets the value of
      that option; <b>+O</b> unsets it. If <i>shopt_option</i> is not supplied,
      the names and values of the shell options accepted by <b>shopt</b> are
      printed on the standard output. If the invocation option is <b>+O</b>, the
      output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.</dd>
  <dt><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd>A <b>--</b> signals the end of options and disables further option
      processing. Any arguments after the <b>--</b> are treated as filenames and
      arguments. An argument of <b>-</b> is equivalent to <b>--</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> also interprets a number of multi-character options.
    These options must appear on the command line before the single-character
    options to be recognized.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ARGUMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#ARGUMENTS">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the
    <b>-c</b> nor the <b>-s</b> option has been supplied, the first argument is
    assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. If <b>bash</b>
    is invoked in this fashion, <b>$0</b> is set to the name of the file, and
    the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments. <b>Bash</b>
    reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. <b>Bash</b>'s exit
    status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no
    commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to
    open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the
    shell searches the directories in <small><b>PATH</b></small> for the
  script.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INVOCATION"><a class="permalink" href="#INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A <i>login shell</i> is one whose first character of argument zero
    is a <b>-</b>, or one started with the <b>--login</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">An <i>interactive</i> shell is one started without non-option
    arguments (unless <b>-s</b> is specified) and without the <b>-c</b> option,
    whose standard input and error are both connected to terminals (as
    determined by <i>isatty</i>(3)), or one started with the <b>-i</b> option.
    <small><b>PS1</b></small> is set and <b>$-</b> includes <b>i</b> if
    <b>bash</b> is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file to
    test this state.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following paragraphs describe how <b>bash</b> executes its
    startup files. If any of the files exist but cannot be read, <b>bash</b>
    reports an error. Tildes are expanded in filenames as described below under
    <b>Tilde Expansion</b> in the <small><b>EXPANSION</b></small> section.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a
    non-interactive shell with the <b>--login</b> option, it first reads and
    executes commands from the file <i>/etc/profile</i>, if that file exists.
    After reading that file, it looks for <i>~/.bash_profile</i>,
    <i>~/.bash_login</i>, and <i>~/.profile</i>, in that order, and reads and
    executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The
    <b>--noprofile</b> option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit
    this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login
    shell executes the <b>exit</b> builtin command, <b>bash</b> reads and
    executes commands from the file <i>~/.bash_logout</i>, if it exists.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started,
    <b>bash</b> reads and executes commands from <i>~/.bashrc</i>, if that file
    exists. This may be inhibited by using the <b>--norc</b> option. The
    <b>--rcfile</b> <i>file</i> option will force <b>bash</b> to read and
    execute commands from <i>file</i> instead of <i>~/.bashrc</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> is started non-interactively, to run a shell
    script, for example, it looks for the variable
    <small><b>BASH_ENV</b></small> in the environment, expands its value if it
    appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and
    execute. <b>Bash</b> behaves as if the following command were executed:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">if [ -n &quot;$BASH_ENV&quot; ]; then .
  &quot;$BASH_ENV&quot;; fi</div>
<p class="Pp">but the value of the <small><b>PATH</b></small> variable is not
    used to search for the filename.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>bash</b> is invoked with the name <b>sh</b>, it tries to
    mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of <b>sh</b> as closely as
    possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well. When invoked as an
    interactive login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the <b>--login</b>
    option, it first attempts to read and execute commands from
    <i>/etc/profile</i> and <i>~/.profile</i>, in that order. The
    <b>--noprofile</b> option may be used to inhibit this behavior. When invoked
    as an interactive shell with the name <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> looks for the
    variable <b>ENV</b>, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the
    expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. Since a shell
    invoked as <b>sh</b> does not attempt to read and execute commands from any
    other startup files, the <b>--rcfile</b> option has no effect. A
    non-interactive shell invoked with the name <b>sh</b> does not attempt to
    read any other startup files. When invoked as <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> enters
    <i>posix</i> mode after the startup files are read.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> is started in <i>posix</i> mode, as with the
    <b>--posix</b> command line option, it follows the POSIX standard for
    startup files. In this mode, interactive shells expand the
    <small><b>ENV</b></small> variable and commands are read and executed from
    the file whose name is the expanded value. No other startup files are
  read.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> attempts to determine when it is being run with its
    standard input connected to a network connection, as when executed by the
    historical remote shell daemon, usually <i>rshd</i>, or the secure shell
    daemon <i>sshd</i>. If <b>bash</b> determines it is being run
    non-interactively in this fashion, it reads and executes commands from
    <i>~/.bashrc</i>, if that file exists and is readable. It will not do this
    if invoked as <b>sh</b>. The <b>--norc</b> option may be used to inhibit
    this behavior, and the <b>--rcfile</b> option may be used to force another
    file to be read, but neither <i>rshd</i> nor <i>sshd</i> generally invoke
    the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not
    equal to the real user (group) id, and the <b>-p</b> option is not supplied,
    no startup files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the
    environment, the <b>SHELLOPTS</b>, <b>BASHOPTS</b>, <b>CDPATH</b>, and
    <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> variables, if they appear in the
    environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is set to the real user
    id. If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior
    is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Simple_Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Simple_Commands">Simple
  Commands</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>simple command</i> is a sequence of optional variable
    assignments followed by <b>blank</b>-separated words and redirections, and
    terminated by a <i>control operator</i>. The first word specifies the
    command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero. The remaining words
    are passed as arguments to the invoked command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value of a <i>simple command</i> is its exit status, or
    128+<i>n</i> if the command is terminated by signal <i>n</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Pipelines"><a class="permalink" href="#Pipelines">Pipelines</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>pipeline</i> is a sequence of one or more commands separated
    by one of the control operators <b>|</b> or <b>|&amp;</b>. The format for a
    pipeline is:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">[<b>time</b> [<b>-p</b>]] [ ! ] <i>command1</i> [
    [<b>|</b>&#x23AA;<b>|&amp;</b>] <i>command2</i> ... ]</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The standard output of <i>command1</i> is connected via a pipe to
    the standard input of <i>command2</i>. This connection is performed before
    any redirections specified by the <i>command1</i>(see
    <small><b>REDIRECTION</b></small> below). If <b>|&amp;</b> is used,
    <i>command1</i>'s standard error, in addition to its standard output, is
    connected to <i>command2</i>'s standard input through the pipe; it is
    shorthand for <b>2&gt;&amp;1 |</b>. This implicit redirection of the
    standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections
    specified by <i>command1</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last
    command, unless the <b>pipefail</b> option is enabled. If <b>pipefail</b> is
    enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost)
    command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit
    successfully. If the reserved word <b>!</b> precedes a pipeline, the exit
    status of that pipeline is the logical negation of the exit status as
    described above. The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to
    terminate before returning a value.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>time</b> reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed
    as well as user and system time consumed by its execution are reported when
    the pipeline terminates. The <b>-p</b> option changes the output format to
    that specified by POSIX. When the shell is in <i>posix mode</i>, it does not
    recognize <b>time</b> as a reserved word if the next token begins with a
    `-'. The <small><b>TIMEFORMAT</b></small> variable may be set to a format
    string that specifies how the timing information should be displayed; see
    the description of <small><b>TIMEFORMAT</b></small> under <b>Shell
    Variables</b> below.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the shell is in <i>posix mode</i>, <b>time</b> may be
    followed by a newline. In this case, the shell displays the total user and
    system time consumed by the shell and its children. The
    <small><b>TIMEFORMAT</b></small> variable may be used to specify the format
    of the time information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each command in a multi-command pipeline, where pipes are created,
    is executed in a <i>subshell</i>, which is a separate process. See
    <small><b>COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</b></small> for a description of
    subshells and a subshell environment. If the <b>lastpipe</b> option is
    enabled using the <b>shopt</b> builtin (see the description of <b>shopt</b>
    below), the last element of a pipeline may be run by the shell process when
    job control is not active.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Lists"><a class="permalink" href="#Lists">Lists</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>list</i> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by
    one of the operators <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, or
    <b>||</b>, and optionally terminated by one of <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, or
    <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of these list operators, <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> have
    equal precedence, followed by <b>;</b> and <b>&amp;</b>, which have equal
    precedence.</p>
<p class="Pp">A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a <i>list</i>
    instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a command is terminated by the control operator <b>&amp;</b>,
    the shell executes the command in the <i>background</i> in a subshell. The
    shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.
    These are referred to as <i>asynchronous</i> commands. Commands separated by
    a <b>;</b> are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to
    terminate in turn. The return status is the exit status of the last command
    executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated
    by the <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> control operators, respectively. AND
    and OR lists are executed with left associativity. An AND list has the
  form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>command1</i> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <i>command2</i></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>command2</i> is executed if, and only if, <i>command1</i>
    returns an exit status of zero (success).</p>
<p class="Pp">An OR list has the form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>command1</i> <b>||</b> <i>command2</i></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>command2</i> is executed if, and only if, <i>command1</i>
    returns a non-zero exit status. The return status of AND and OR lists is the
    exit status of the last command executed in the list.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Compound_Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Compound_Commands">Compound
  Commands</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>compound command</i> is one of the following. In most cases a
    <i>list</i> in a command's description may be separated from the rest of the
    command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place
    of a semicolon.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd><i>list</i> is executed in a subshell (see <small><b>COMMAND EXECUTION
      ENVIRONMENT</b></small> below for a description of a subshell
      environment). Variable assignments and builtin commands that affect the

      The return status is the exit status of <i>list</i>.</dd>
  <dt>{ <i>list</i>; }</dt>
  <dd><i>list</i> is simply executed in the current shell environment.
      <i>list</i> must be terminated with a newline or semicolon. This is known
      as a <i>group command</i>. The return status is the exit status of
      <i>list</i>. Note that unlike the metacharacters <b>(</b> and <b>)</b>,
      <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are <i>reserved words</i> and must occur where a
      reserved word is permitted to be recognized. Since they do not cause a

      another shell metacharacter.</dd>
  <dt>((<i>expression</i>))</dt>
  <dd>The <i>expression</i> is evaluated according to the rules described below
      under <b>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</b>. If the value of the expression is
      non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the return status is 1. The
      <i>expression</i> undergoes the same expansions as if it were within
      double quotes, but double quote characters in <i>expression</i> are not
      treated specially and are removed.</dd>

      expansion. The shell performs tilde expansion, parameter and variable
      expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process
      substitution, and quote removal on those words (the expansions that would
      occur if the words were enclosed in double quotes). Conditional operators
      such as <b>-f</b> must be unquoted to be recognized as primaries.
    <p class="Pp">When used with <b>[[</b>, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b>
        operators sort lexicographically using the current locale.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When the <b>==</b> and <b>!=</b> operators are used, the
        string to the right of the operator is considered a pattern and matched
        according to the rules described below under <b>Pattern Matching</b>, as
        if the <b>extglob</b> shell option were enabled. The <b>=</b> operator
        is equivalent to <b>==</b>. If the <b>nocasematch</b> shell option is
        enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic
        characters. The return value is 0 if the string matches (<b>==</b>) or
        does not match (<b>!=</b>) the pattern, and 1 otherwise. Any part of the
        pattern may be quoted to force the quoted portion to be matched as a
        string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An additional binary operator, <b>=~</b>, is available, with
        the same precedence as <b>==</b> and <b>!=</b>. When it is used, the
        string to the right of the operator is considered a POSIX extended
        regular expression and matched accordingly (using the POSIX
        <i>regcomp</i> and <i>regexec</i> interfaces usually described in
        <i>regex</i>(3)). The return value is 0 if the string matches the
        pattern, and 1 otherwise. If the regular expression is syntactically
        incorrect, the conditional expression's return value is 2. If the
        <b>nocasematch</b> shell option is enabled, the match is performed
        without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. If any part of the
        pattern is quoted, the quoted portion is matched literally. This means
        every character in the quoted portion matches itself, instead of having
        any special pattern matching meaning. If the pattern is stored in a
        shell variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire pattern
        to be matched literally. Treat bracket expressions in regular
        expressions carefully, since normal quoting and pattern characters lose
        their meanings between brackets.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The pattern will match if it matches any part of the string.
        Anchor the pattern using the <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> regular expression
        operators to force it to match the entire string. The array variable
        <small><b>BASH_REMATCH</b></small> records which parts of the string
        matched the pattern. The element of <small><b>BASH_REMATCH</b></small>
        with index 0 contains the portion of the string matching the entire
        regular expression. Substrings matched by parenthesized subexpressions
        within the regular expression are saved in the remaining
        <small><b>BASH_REMATCH</b></small> indices. The element of
        <small><b>BASH_REMATCH</b></small> with index <i>n</i> is the portion of
        the string matching the <i>n</i>th parenthesized subexpression. Bash
        sets <small><b>BASH_REMATCH</b></small> in the global scope; declaring
        it as a local variable will lead to unexpected results.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Coprocesses"><a class="permalink" href="#Coprocesses">Coprocesses</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>coprocess</i> is a shell command preceded by the
    <b>coproc</b> reserved word. A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a
    subshell, as if the command had been terminated with the <b>&amp;</b>
    control operator, with a two-way pipe established between the executing
    shell and the coprocess.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntax for a coprocess is:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>coproc</b> [<i>NAME</i>] <i>command</i>
  [<i>redirections</i>]</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This creates a coprocess named <i>NAME</i>. <i>command</i> may be
    either a simple command or a compound command (see above). <i>NAME</i> is a
    shell variable name. If <i>NAME</i> is not supplied, the default name is
    <b>COPROC</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The recommended form to use for a coprocess is</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>coproc</b> <i>NAME</i> { <i>command</i> [<i>redirections</i>];
    }</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This form is recommended because simple commands result in the
    coprocess always being named <b>COPROC</b>, and it is simpler to use and
    more complete than the other compound commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>command</i> is a compound command, <i>NAME</i> is optional.
    The word following <b>coproc</b> determines whether that word is interpreted
    as a variable name: it is interpreted as <i>NAME</i> if it is not a reserved
    word that introduces a compound command. If <i>command</i> is a simple
    command, <i>NAME</i> is not allowed; this is to avoid confusion between
    <i>NAME</i> and the first word of the simple command.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array
    variable (see <b>Arrays</b> below) named <i>NAME</i> in the context of the
    executing shell. The standard output of <i>command</i> is connected via a
    pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor
    is assigned to <i>NAME</i>[0]. The standard input of <i>command</i> is
    connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that
    file descriptor is assigned to <i>NAME</i>[1]. This pipe is established
    before any redirections specified by the command (see
    <small><b>REDIRECTION</b></small> below). The file descriptors can be
    utilized as arguments to shell commands and redirections using standard word
    expansions. Other than those created to execute command and process
    substitutions, the file descriptors are not available in subshells.</p>
<p class="Pp">The process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is
    available as the value of the variable <i>NAME</i>_PID. The <b>wait</b>
    builtin command may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command, the
    <b>coproc</b> command always returns success. The return status of a
    coprocess is the exit status of <i>command</i>.</p>

  Function Definitions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command
    and executes a compound command with a new set of positional parameters.
    Shell functions are declared as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="fname"><a class="permalink" href="#fname"><i>fname</i> ()
    <i>compound-command</i> [<i>redirection</i>]</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>function</b> <i>fname</i> [()] <i>compound-command</i>
    [<i>redirection</i>]</dt>
  <dd>This defines a function named <i>fname</i>. The reserved word
      <b>function</b> is optional. If the <b>function</b> reserved word is
      supplied, the parentheses are optional. The <i>body</i> of the function is
      the compound command <i>compound-command</i> (see <b>Compound Commands</b>
      above). That command is usually a <i>list</i> of commands between { and },
      but may be any command listed under <b>Compound Commands</b> above. If the
      <b>function</b> reserved word is used, but the parentheses are not
      supplied, the braces are recommended. <i>compound-command</i> is executed
      whenever <i>fname</i> is specified as the name of a simple command. When
      in <i>posix mode</i>, <i>fname</i> must be a valid shell <i>name</i> and
      may not be the name of one of the POSIX <i>special builtins</i>. In
      default mode, a function name can be any unquoted shell word that does not
      contain <b>$</b>. Any redirections (see <small><b>REDIRECTION</b></small>
      below) specified when a function is defined are performed when the
      function is executed. The exit status of a function definition is zero
      unless a syntax error occurs or a readonly function with the same name
      already exists. When executed, the exit status of a function is the exit
      status of the last command executed in the body. (See
      <small><b>FUNCTIONS</b></small> below.)</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMENTS">COMMENTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the
    <b>interactive_comments</b> option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin is enabled
    (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below), a word beginning
    with <b>#</b> causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to
    be ignored. An interactive shell without the <b>interactive_comments</b>
    option enabled does not allow comments. The <b>interactive_comments</b>
    option is on by default in interactive shells.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="QUOTING"><a class="permalink" href="#QUOTING">QUOTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Quoting</i> is used to remove the special meaning of certain
    characters or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to disable special
    treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being
    recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each of the <i>metacharacters</i> listed above under
    <small><b>DEFINITIONS</b></small> has special meaning to the shell and must
    be quoted if it is to represent itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see
    <small><b>HISTORY EXPANSION</b></small> below), the <i>history expansion</i>
    character, usually <b>!</b>, must be quoted to prevent history
  expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three quoting mechanisms: the <i>escape character</i>,
    single quotes, and double quotes.</p>
<p class="Pp">A non-quoted backslash (<b>\</b>) is the <i>escape character</i>.
    It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the
    exception of &lt;newline&gt;. If a <b>\</b>&lt;newline&gt; pair appears, and
    the backslash is not itself quoted, the <b>\</b>&lt;newline&gt; is treated
    as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and
    effectively ignored).</p>
<p class="Pp">Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value
    of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between
    single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.</p>
<p class="Pp">Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value
    of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of <b>$</b>,
    <b>`</b>, <b>\</b>, and, when history expansion is enabled, <b>!</b>. When
    the shell is in <i>posix mode</i>, the <b>!</b> has no special meaning
    within double quotes, even when history expansion is enabled. The characters
    <b>$</b> and <b>`</b> retain their special meaning within double quotes. The
    backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the
    following characters: <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>&quot;</b>, <b>\</b>, or
    <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by
    preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be
    performed unless an <b>!</b> appearing in double quotes is escaped using a
    backslash. The backslash preceding the <b>!</b> is not removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The special parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> have special meaning
    when in double quotes (see <small><b>PARAMETERS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">Character sequences of the form <b>$</b>'<i>string</i>' are
    treated as a special variant of single quotes. The sequence expands to
    <i>string</i>, with backslash-escaped characters in <i>string</i> replaced
    as specified by the ANSI C standard. Backslash escape sequences, if present,
    are decoded as follows:</p>

<p class="Pp">The expanded result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had

<p class="Pp">A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign
    (<b>$</b>&quot;<i>string</i>&quot;) will cause the string to be translated

    or if the string is not translated, the dollar sign is ignored. This is a
    form of double quoting, so the string remains double-quoted by default,
    whether or not it is translated and replaced. If the
    <b>noexpand_translation</b> option is enabled using the <b>shopt</b>
    builtin, translated strings are single-quoted instead of double-quoted. See

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PARAMETERS"><a class="permalink" href="#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A <i>parameter</i> is an entity that stores values. It can be a
    <i>name</i>, a number, or one of the special characters listed below under
    <b>Special Parameters</b>. A <i>variable</i> is a parameter denoted by a
    <i>name</i>. A variable has a <i>value</i> and zero or more
    <i>attributes</i>. Attributes are assigned using the <b>declare</b> builtin
    command (see <b>declare</b> below in <b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value. The null
    string is a valid value. Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by
    using the <b>unset</b> builtin command (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>variable</i> may be assigned to by a statement of the
  form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>name</i>=[<i>value</i>]</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If <i>value</i> is not given, the variable is assigned the null
    string. All <i>values</i> undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable
    expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal
    (see <small><b>EXPANSION</b></small> below). If the variable has its
    <b>integer</b> attribute set, then <i>value</i> is evaluated as an
    arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is not used (see
    <b>Arithmetic Expansion</b> below). Word splitting and pathname expansion
    are not performed. Assignment statements may also appear as arguments to the
    <b>alias</b>, <b>declare</b>, <b>typeset</b>, <b>export</b>,
    <b>readonly</b>, and <b>local</b> builtin commands (<i>declaration</i>
    commands). When in <i>posix mode</i>, these builtins may appear in a command
    after one or more instances of the <b>command</b> builtin and retain these
    assignment statement properties.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value
    to a shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append to
    or add to the variable's previous value. This includes arguments to builtin
    commands such as <b>declare</b> that accept assignment statements
    (<i>declaration</i> commands). When += is applied to a variable for which
    the <b>integer</b> attribute has been set, <i>value</i> is evaluated as an
    arithmetic expression and added to the variable's current value, which is
    also evaluated. When += is applied to an array variable using compound
    assignment (see <b>Arrays</b> below), the variable's value is not unset (as
    it is when using =), and new values are appended to the array beginning at
    one greater than the array's maximum index (for indexed arrays) or added as
    additional key-value pairs in an associative array. When applied to a
    string-valued variable, <i>value</i> is expanded and appended to the
    variable's value.</p>
<p class="Pp">A variable can be assigned the <i>nameref</i> attribute using the
    <b>-n</b> option to the <b>declare</b> or <b>local</b> builtin commands (see
    the descriptions of <b>declare</b> and <b>local</b> below) to create a
    <i>nameref</i>, or a reference to another variable. This allows variables to
    be manipulated indirectly. Whenever the nameref variable is referenced,
    assigned to, unset, or has its attributes modified (other than using or
    changing the <i>nameref</i> attribute itself), the operation is actually
    performed on the variable specified by the nameref variable's value. A
    nameref is commonly used within shell functions to refer to a variable whose
    name is passed as an argument to the function. For instance, if a variable
    name is passed to a shell function as its first argument, running</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">declare -n ref=$1</div>
<p class="Pp">inside the function creates a nameref variable <b>ref</b> whose
    value is the variable name passed as the first argument. References and
    assignments to <b>ref</b>, and changes to its attributes, are treated as
    references, assignments, and attribute modifications to the variable whose
    name was passed as <b>$1</b>. If the control variable in a <b>for</b> loop
    has the nameref attribute, the list of words can be a list of shell
    variables, and a name reference will be established for each word in the
    list, in turn, when the loop is executed. Array variables cannot be given
    the <b>nameref</b> attribute. However, nameref variables can reference array
    variables and subscripted array variables. Namerefs can be unset using the
    <b>-n</b> option to the <b>unset</b> builtin. Otherwise, if <b>unset</b> is
    executed with the name of a nameref variable as an argument, the variable
    referenced by the nameref variable will be unset.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Positional_Parameters"><a class="permalink" href="#Positional_Parameters">Positional
  Parameters</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>positional parameter</i> is a parameter denoted by one or
    more digits, other than the single digit 0. Positional parameters are
    assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be
    reassigned using the <b>set</b> builtin command. Positional parameters may
    not be assigned to with assignment statements. The positional parameters are
    temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed (see
    <small><b>FUNCTIONS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit
    is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see
    <small><b>EXPANSION</b></small> below).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Special_Parameters"><a class="permalink" href="#Special_Parameters">Special

<p class="Pp">The shell treats several parameters specially. These parameters

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the
      expansion is not within double quotes, each positional parameter expands
      to a separate word. In contexts where it is performed, those words are
      subject to further word splitting and pathname expansion. When the
      expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with
      the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the
      <small><b>IFS</b></small> special variable. That is, &quot;<b>$*</b>&quot;
      is equivalent to &quot;<b>$1</b><i>c</i><b>$2</b><i>c</i><b>...</b>&quot;,
      where <i>c</i> is the first character of the value of the
      <small><b>IFS</b></small> variable. If <small><b>IFS</b></small> is unset,
      the parameters are separated by spaces. If <small><b>IFS</b></small> is
      null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.</dd>
  <dt><b>@</b></dt>
  <dd>Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. In contexts where
      word splitting is performed, this expands each positional parameter to a
      separate word; if not within double quotes, these words are subject to
      word splitting. In contexts where word splitting is not performed, this
      expands to a single word with each positional parameter separated by a
      space. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter
      expands to a separate word. That is, &quot;<b>$@</b>&quot; is equivalent
      to &quot;<b>$1</b>&quot; &quot;<b>$2</b>&quot; ... If the double-quoted
      expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is
      joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of
      the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word. When
      there are no positional parameters, &quot;<b>$@</b>&quot; and <b>$@</b>
      expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).</dd>

      <b>set</b> builtin command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the
      <b>-i</b> option).</dd>
  <dt><b>$</b></dt>
  <dd>Expands to the process ID of the shell. In a subshell, it expands to the

  <dt><b>!</b></dt>
  <dd>Expands to the process ID of the job most recently placed into the

  <dt><b>0</b></dt>
  <dd>Expands to the name of the shell or shell script. This is set at shell
      initialization. If <b>bash</b> is invoked with a file of commands,
      <b>$0</b> is set to the name of that file. If <b>bash</b> is started with
      the <b>-c</b> option, then <b>$0</b> is set to the first argument after

  <dd>A colon-separated list of shell patterns (see <b>Pattern Matching</b>)
      defining the list of filenames to be ignored by command search using
      <b>PATH</b>. Files whose full pathnames match one of these patterns are
      not considered executable files for the purposes of completion and command

  <dt id="GLOBIGNORE"><a class="permalink" href="#GLOBIGNORE"><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of file names to be
      ignored by pathname expansion. If a file name matched by a pathname
      expansion pattern also matches one of the patterns in <b>GLOBIGNORE</b>,
      it is removed from the list of matches.</dd>
  <dt id="HISTCONTROL"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTCONTROL"><b>HISTCONTROL</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the
      history list. If the list of values includes <i>ignorespace</i>, lines
      which begin with a <b>space</b> character are not saved in the history
      list. A value of <i>ignoredups</i> causes lines matching the previous
      history entry to not be saved. A value of <i>ignoreboth</i> is shorthand
      for <i>ignorespace</i> and <i>ignoredups</i>. A value of <i>erasedups</i>
      causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the
      history list before that line is saved. Any value not in the above list is
      ignored. If <small><b>HISTCONTROL</b></small> is unset, or does not
      include a valid value, all lines read by the shell parser are saved on the
      history list, subject to the value of <b>HISTIGNORE</b>. The second and
      subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are
      added to the history regardless of the value of <b>HISTCONTROL</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="HISTFILE"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTFILE"><b>HISTFILE</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The name of the file in which command history is saved (see
      <small><b>HISTORY</b></small> below). The default value is
      <i>~/.bash_history</i>. If unset, the command history is not saved when a
      shell exits.</dd>
  <dt id="HISTFILESIZE"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTFILESIZE"><b>HISTFILESIZE</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The maximum number of lines contained in the history file. When this
      variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if necessary,
      to contain no more than that number of lines by removing the oldest
      entries. The history file is also truncated to this size after writing it
      when a shell exits. If the value is 0, the history file is truncated to
      zero size. Non-numeric values and numeric values less than zero inhibit
      truncation. The shell sets the default value to the value of
      <b>HISTSIZE</b> after reading any startup files.</dd>
  <dt id="HISTIGNORE"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTIGNORE"><b>HISTIGNORE</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command lines
      should be saved on the history list. Each pattern is anchored at the
      beginning of the line and must match the complete line (no implicit
      `<b>*</b>' is appended). Each pattern is tested against the line after the
      checks specified by <small><b>HISTCONTROL</b></small> are applied. In
      addition to the normal shell pattern matching characters, `<b>&amp;</b>'
      matches the previous history line. `<b>&amp;</b>' may be escaped using a
      backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match. The second
      and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and
      are added to the history regardless of the value of <b>HISTIGNORE</b>. The
      pattern matching honors the setting of the <b>extglob</b> shell
    option.</dd>
  <dt id="HISTSIZE"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTSIZE"><b>HISTSIZE</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The number of commands to remember in the command history (see
      <small><b>HISTORY</b></small> below). If the value is 0, commands are not
      saved in the history list. Numeric values less than zero result in every
      command being saved on the history list (there is no limit). The shell
      sets the default value to 500 after reading any startup files.</dd>
  <dt id="HISTTIMEFORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTTIMEFORMAT"><b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If this variable is set and not null, its value is used as a format string
      for <i>strftime</i>(3) to print the time stamp associated with each
      history entry displayed by the <b>history</b> builtin. If this variable is
      set, time stamps are written to the history file so they may be preserved
      across shell sessions. This uses the history comment character to
      distinguish timestamps from other history lines.</dd>
  <dt id="HOME"><a class="permalink" href="#HOME"><b>HOME</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the

      performing tilde expansion.</dd>
  <dt id="HOSTFILE"><a class="permalink" href="#HOSTFILE"><b>HOSTFILE</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Contains the name of a file in the same format as <i>/etc/hosts</i> that
      should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname. The list of
      possible hostname completions may be changed while the shell is running;
      the next time hostname completion is attempted after the value is changed,
      <b>bash</b> adds the contents of the new file to the existing list. If
      <small><b>HOSTFILE</b></small> is set, but has no value, or does not name
      a readable file, <b>bash</b> attempts to read <i>/etc/hosts</i> to obtain
      the list of possible hostname completions. When
      <small><b>HOSTFILE</b></small> is unset, the hostname list is
    cleared.</dd>
  <dt id="IFS"><a class="permalink" href="#IFS"><b>IFS</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>Internal Field Separator</i> that is used for word splitting after
      expansion and to split lines into words with the <b>read</b> builtin

    ``&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;''.</dd>
  <dt id="IGNOREEOF"><a class="permalink" href="#IGNOREEOF"><b>IGNOREEOF</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an
      <small><b>EOF</b></small> character as the sole input. If set, the value
      is the number of consecutive <small><b>EOF</b></small> characters which
      must be typed as the first characters on an input line before <b>bash</b>
      exits. If the variable exists but does not have a numeric value, or has no
      value, the default value is 10. If it does not exist,
      <small><b>EOF</b></small> signifies the end of input to the shell.</dd>
  <dt id="INPUTRC"><a class="permalink" href="#INPUTRC"><b>INPUTRC</b></a></dt>

      directory.</dd>
  <dt id="MAILCHECK"><a class="permalink" href="#MAILCHECK"><b>MAILCHECK</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies how often (in seconds) <b>bash</b> checks for mail. The default

      disables mail checking.</dd>
  <dt id="MAILPATH"><a class="permalink" href="#MAILPATH"><b>MAILPATH</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A colon-separated list of filenames to be checked for mail. The message to

<h2 class="Ss" id="Arrays"><a class="permalink" href="#Arrays">Arrays</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array
    variables. Any variable may be used as an indexed array; the <b>declare</b>
    builtin will explicitly declare an array. There is no maximum limit on the
    size of an array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned
    contiguously. Indexed arrays are referenced using integers (including
    arithmetic expressions) and are zero-based; associative arrays are
    referenced using arbitrary strings. Unless otherwise noted, indexed array
    indices must be non-negative integers.</p>
<p class="Pp">An indexed array is created automatically if any variable is
    assigned to using the syntax <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]=<i>value</i>. The
    <i>subscript</i> is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate
    to a number. To explicitly declare an indexed array, use <b>declare -a
    <i>name</i></b> (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below).
    <b>declare -a <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]</b> is also accepted; the
    <i>subscript</i> is ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Associative arrays are created using <b>declare -A
    <i>name</i></b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the
    <b>declare</b> and <b>readonly</b> builtins. Each attribute applies to all
    members of an array.</p>
<p class="Pp">Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form
    <i>name</i>=<b>(</b>value<i>1</i> ... value<i>n</i><b>)</b>, where each
    <i>value</i> may be of the form [<i>subscript</i>]=<i>string</i>. Indexed
    array assignments do not require anything but <i>string</i>. Each
    <i>value</i> in the list is expanded using all the shell expansions
    described below under <b>EXPANSION</b>. When assigning to indexed arrays, if
    the optional brackets and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to;
    otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last index assigned to by
    the statement plus one. Indexing starts at zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">When assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound
    assignment may be either assignment statements, for which the subscript is
    required, or a list of words that is interpreted as a sequence of
    alternating keys and values: <i>name</i>=<b>( </b><i>key1 value1 key2
    value2</i> ...<b>)</b>. These are treated identically to
    <i>name</i>=<b>(</b> [<i>key1</i>]=<i>value1</i> [<i>key2</i>]=<i>value2</i>
    ...<b>)</b>. The first word in the list determines how the remaining words
    are interpreted; all assignments in a list must be of the same type. When
    using key/value pairs, the keys may not be missing or empty; a final missing
    value is treated like the empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">This syntax is also accepted by the <b>declare</b> builtin.
    Individual array elements may be assigned to using the
    <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]=<i>value</i> syntax introduced above. When
    assigning to an indexed array, if <i>name</i> is subscripted by a negative
    number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the
    maximum index of <i>name</i>, so negative indices count back from the end of
    the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.</p>
<p class="Pp">The += operator will append to an array variable when assigning
    using the compound assignment syntax; see <small><b>PARAMETERS</b></small>
    above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any element of an array may be referenced using
    ${<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]}. The braces are required to avoid conflicts
    with pathname expansion. If <i>subscript</i> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the
    word expands to all members of <i>name</i>. These subscripts differ only
    when the word appears within double quotes. If the word is double-quoted,
    ${<i>name</i>[*]} expands to a single word with the value of each array
    member separated by the first character of the <small><b>IFS</b></small>
    special variable, and ${<i>name</i>[@]} expands each element of <i>name</i>
    to a separate word. When there are no array members, ${<i>name</i>[@]}
    expands to nothing. If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the
    expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the
    original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the
    last part of the original word. This is analogous to the expansion of the
    special parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> (see <b>Special Parameters</b>
    above). ${#<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]} expands to the length of
    ${<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]}. If <i>subscript</i> is <b>*</b> or
    <b>@</b>, the expansion is the number of elements in the array. If the
    <i>subscript</i> used to reference an element of an indexed array evaluates
    to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as relative to one greater
    than the maximum index of the array, so negative indices count back from the
    end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.</p>
<p class="Pp">Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to
    referencing the array with a subscript of 0. Any reference to a variable
    using a valid subscript is legal, and <b>bash</b> will create an array if
    necessary.</p>
<p class="Pp">An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been
    assigned a value. The null string is a valid value.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as
    the values. ${<b>!</b><i>name</i>[<i>@</i>]} and
    ${<b>!</b><i>name</i>[<i>*</i>]} expand to the indices assigned in array
    variable <i>name</i>. The treatment when in double quotes is similar to the
    expansion of the special parameters <i>@</i> and <i>*</i> within double
    quotes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>unset</b> builtin is used to destroy arrays. <b>unset</b>
    <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>] destroys the array element at index
    <i>subscript</i>, for both indexed and associative arrays. Negative
    subscripts to indexed arrays are interpreted as described above. Unsetting
    the last element of an array variable does not unset the variable.
    <b>unset</b> <i>name</i>, where <i>name</i> is an array, removes the entire
    array. <b>unset</b> <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>], where <i>subscript</i> is
    <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, behaves differently depending on whether <i>name</i>
    is an indexed or associative array. If <i>name</i> is an associative array,
    this unsets the element with subscript <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>. If <i>name</i>
    is an indexed array, unset removes all of the elements but does not remove
    the array itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using a variable name with a subscript as an argument to a
    command, such as with <b>unset</b>, without using the word expansion syntax
    described above, the argument is subject to pathname expansion. If pathname
    expansion is not desired, the argument should be quoted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>declare</b>, <b>local</b>, and <b>readonly</b> builtins
    each accept a <b>-a</b> option to specify an indexed array and a <b>-A</b>
    option to specify an associative array. If both options are supplied,
    <b>-A</b> takes precedence. The <b>read</b> builtin accepts a <b>-a</b>
    option to assign a list of words read from the standard input to an array.
    The <b>set</b> and <b>declare</b> builtins display array values in a way
    that allows them to be reused as assignments.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXPANSION"><a class="permalink" href="#EXPANSION">EXPANSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split
    into words. There are seven kinds of expansion performed: <i>brace
    expansion</i>, <i>tilde expansion</i>, <i>parameter and variable
    expansion</i>, <i>command substitution</i>, <i>arithmetic expansion</i>,
    <i>word splitting</i>, and <i>pathname expansion</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion,
    parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command
    substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname
    expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion
    available: <i>process substitution</i>. This is performed at the same time
    as tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and command
    substitution.</p>
<p class="Pp">After these expansions are performed, quote characters present in
    the original word are removed unless they have been quoted themselves
    (<i>quote removal</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can
    increase the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a
    single word to a single word. The only exceptions to this are the expansions
    of &quot;<b>$@</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[@]}</b>&quot;,
    and, in most cases, <b>$*</b> and <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[*]}</b> as
    explained above (see <b>PARAMETERS</b>).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Brace_Expansion"><a class="permalink" href="#Brace_Expansion">Brace
  Expansion</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Brace expansion</i> is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings
    may be generated. This mechanism is similar to <i>pathname expansion</i>,
    but the filenames generated need not exist. Patterns to be brace expanded
    take the form of an optional <i>preamble</i>, followed by either a series of
    comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces,
    followed by an optional <i>postscript</i>. The preamble is prefixed to each
    string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to
    each resulting string, expanding left to right.</p>
<p class="Pp">Brace expansions may be nested. The results of each expanded
    string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved. For example,
    a<b>{</b>d,c,b<b>}</b>e expands into `ade ace abe'.</p>
<p class="Pp">A sequence expression takes the form
    <b>{</b><i>x</i><b>..</b><i>y</i><b>[..</b><i>incr</i><b>]}</b>, where
    <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are either integers or single letters, and
    <i>incr</i>, an optional increment, is an integer. When integers are
    supplied, the expression expands to each number between <i>x</i> and
    <i>y</i>, inclusive. Supplied integers may be prefixed with <i>0</i> to
    force each term to have the same width. When either <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>
    begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to
    contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary. When
    letters are supplied, the expression expands to each character
    lexicographically between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, inclusive, using the
    default C locale. Note that both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> must be of the same
    type (integer or letter). When the increment is supplied, it is used as the
    difference between each term. The default increment is 1 or -1 as
    appropriate.</p>
<p class="Pp">Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any
    characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result. It is
    strictly textual. <b>Bash</b> does not apply any syntactic interpretation to
    the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.</p>
<p class="Pp">A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening
    and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence
    expression. Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged. A
    <b>{</b> or <b>,</b> may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being
    considered part of a brace expression. To avoid conflicts with parameter
    expansion, the string <b>${</b> is not considered eligible for brace
    expansion, and inhibits brace expansion until the closing <b>}</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common
    prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above
  example:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}</p>
</div>
or
<div class="Bd-indent">chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}</div>
<p class="Pp">Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with
    historical versions of <b>sh</b>. <b>sh</b> does not treat opening or
    closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves
    them in the output. <b>Bash</b> removes braces from words as a consequence
    of brace expansion. For example, a word entered to <b>sh</b> as
    <i>file{1,2}</i> appears identically in the output. The same word is output
    as <i>file1 file2</i> after expansion by <b>bash</b>. If strict
    compatibility with <b>sh</b> is desired, start <b>bash</b> with the
    <b>+B</b> option or disable brace expansion with the <b>+B</b> option to the
    <b>set</b> command (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small>
  below).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Tilde_Expansion"><a class="permalink" href="#Tilde_Expansion">Tilde
  Expansion</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`<b>~</b>'),
    all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters,
    if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a <i>tilde-prefix</i>. If none
    of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the
    tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible <i>login
    name</i>. If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with
    the value of the shell parameter <b>HOME</b>. If <small><b>HOME</b></small>
    is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted
    instead. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory
    associated with the specified login name.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable
    <small><b>PWD</b></small> replaces the tilde-prefix. If the tilde-prefix is
    a `~-', the value of the shell variable <b>OLDPWD</b>, if it is set, is
    substituted. If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix
    consist of a number <i>N</i>, optionally prefixed by a `+' or a `-', the
    tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory
    stack, as it would be displayed by the <b>dirs</b> builtin invoked with the
    tilde-prefix as an argument. If the characters following the tilde in the
    tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is
    assumed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the
    word is unchanged.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes
    immediately following a <b>:</b> or the first <b>=</b>. In these cases,
    tilde expansion is also performed. Consequently, one may use filenames with
    tildes in assignments to <b>PATH</b>, <b>MAILPATH</b>, and <b>CDPATH</b>,
    and the shell assigns the expanded value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bash also performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the
    conditions of variable assignments (as described above under
    <b>PARAMETERS</b>) when they appear as arguments to simple commands. Bash
    does not do this, except for the <i>declaration</i> commands listed above,
    when in <i>posix mode</i>.</p>

<p class="Pp">The `<b>$</b>' character introduces parameter expansion, command
    substitution, or arithmetic expansion. The parameter name or symbol to be
    expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect
    the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which
    could be interpreted as part of the name.</p>
<p class="Pp">When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first

    command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. If <i>parameter</i> is a

      number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the

      substitution, and quote removal. The match is performed using the rules
      described under <b>Pattern Matching</b> below. In the first form above,

      preceded by <b>%</b> (the fourth form above), it must match at the end of
      the expanded value of <i>parameter</i>. If the expansion of <i>string</i>
      is null, matches of <i>pattern</i> are deleted. If <i>string</i> is null,
      matches of <i>pattern</i> are deleted and the <b>/</b> following
      <i>pattern</i> may be omitted.
    <p class="Pp">If the <b>patsub_replacement</b> shell option is enabled using
        <b>shopt</b>, any unquoted instances of <b>&amp;</b> in <i>string</i>
        are replaced with the matching portion of <i>pattern</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Quoting any part of <i>string</i> inhibits replacement in the
        expansion of the quoted portion, including replacement strings stored in
        shell variables. Backslash will escape <b>&amp;</b> in <i>string</i>;
        the backslash is removed in order to permit a literal <b>&amp;</b> in
        the replacement string. Backslash can also be used to escape a
        backslash; <b>\\</b> results in a literal backslash in the replacement.
        Users should take care if <i>string</i> is double-quoted to avoid
        unwanted interactions between the backslash and double-quoting, since
        backslash has special meaning within double quotes. Pattern substitution
        performs the check for unquoted <b>&amp;</b> after expanding
        <i>string</i>; shell programmers should quote any occurrences of
        <b>&amp;</b> they want to be taken literally in the replacement and
        ensure any instances of <b>&amp;</b> they want to be replaced are
        unquoted.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the <b>nocasematch</b> shell option is enabled, the match
        is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. If
        <i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substitution operation is
        applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the
        resultant list. If <i>parameter</i> is an array variable subscripted

      value of <i>parameter</i> is tested against <i>pattern</i>, and, if it
      matches the pattern, its case is converted. The pattern should not attempt
      to match more than one character. The <b>^</b> operator converts lowercase
      letters matching <i>pattern</i> to uppercase; the <b>,</b> operator
      converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase. The <b>^^</b> and

<p class="Pp"><i>Command substitution</i> allows the output of a command to

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>$(</b><i>command</i><b>)</b></p>
</div>
or
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>`</b><i>command</i><b>`</b></div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> performs the expansion by executing <i>command</i> in
    a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with the
    standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Embedded
    newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting. The
    command substitution <b>$(cat </b><i>file</i><b>)</b> can be replaced by the
    equivalent but faster <b>$(&lt; </b><i>file</i><b>)</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used,
    backslash retains its literal meaning except when followed by <b>$</b>,
    <b>`</b>, or <b>\</b>. The first backquote not preceded by a backslash
    terminates the command substitution. When using the $(<i>command</i>) form,
    all characters between the parentheses make up the command; none are treated
    specially.</p>
<p class="Pp">Command substitutions may be nested. To nest when using the
    backquoted form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting

    expansion is:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>$((</b><i>expression</i><b>))</b></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>expression</i> undergoes the same expansions as if it were
    within double quotes, but double quote characters in <i>expression</i> are
    not treated specially and are removed. All tokens in the expression undergo
    parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.
    The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be evaluated.
    Arithmetic expansions may be nested.</p>
<p class="Pp">The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below

    <b>&lt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b> or <b>&gt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>. The
    process <i>list</i> is run asynchronously, and its input or output appears
    as a filename. This filename is passed as an argument to the current command
    as the result of the expansion. If the <b>&gt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b> form
    is used, writing to the file will provide input for <i>list</i>. If the

  Splitting</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command
    substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double
    quotes for <i>word splitting</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell treats each character of <small><b>IFS</b></small> as a
    delimiter, and splits the results of the other expansions into words using
    these characters as field terminators. If <small><b>IFS</b></small> is
    unset, or its value is exactly
    <b>&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</b>, the default, then sequences
    of <b>&lt;space&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;tab&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b> at
    the beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions are ignored,
    and any sequence of <small><b>IFS</b></small> characters not at the
    beginning or end serves to delimit words. If <small><b>IFS</b></small> has a
    value other than the default, then sequences of the whitespace characters
    <b>space</b>, <b>tab</b>, and <b>newline</b> are ignored at the beginning
    and end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in the value of
    <small><b>IFS</b></small> (an <small><b>IFS</b></small> whitespace
    character). Any character in <small><b>IFS</b></small> that is not
    <small><b>IFS</b></small> whitespace, along with any adjacent
    <small><b>IFS</b></small> whitespace characters, delimits a field. A
    sequence of <small><b>IFS</b></small> whitespace characters is also treated
    as a delimiter. If the value of <small><b>IFS</b></small> is null, no word
    splitting occurs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Explicit null arguments (<b>&quot;&quot;</b> or <b>''</b>) are
    retained and passed to commands as empty strings. Unquoted implicit null
    arguments, resulting from the expansion of parameters that have no values,
    are removed. If a parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes,
    a null argument results and is retained and passed to a command as an empty
    string. When a quoted null argument appears as part of a word whose
    expansion is non-null, the null argument is removed. That is, the word
    <span class="Li">-d''</span> becomes <span class="Li">-d</span> after word
    splitting and null argument removal.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Pathname_Expansion"><a class="permalink" href="#Pathname_Expansion">Pathname
  Expansion</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">After word splitting, unless the <b>-f</b> option has been set,
    <b>bash</b> scans each word for the characters <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, and
    <b>[</b>. If one of these characters appears, and is not quoted, then the
    word is regarded as a <i>pattern</i>, and replaced with an alphabetically
    sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see <small><b>Pattern
    Matching</b></small> below). If no matching filenames are found, and the
    shell option <b>nullglob</b> is not enabled, the word is left unchanged. If
    the <b>nullglob</b> option is set, and no matches are found, the word is
    removed. If the <b>failglob</b> shell option is set, and no matches are
    found, an error message is printed and the command is not executed. If the
    shell option <b>nocaseglob</b> is enabled, the match is performed without
    regard to the case of alphabetic characters. When a pattern is used for
    pathname expansion, the character <b>``.''</b> at the start of a name or
    immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell
    option <b>dotglob</b> is set. In order to match the filenames <b>``.''</b>
    and <b>``..''</b>, the pattern must begin with ``.'' (for example, ``.?''),
    even if <b>dotglob</b> is set. If the <b>globskipdots</b> shell option is
    enabled, the filenames <b>``.''</b> and <b>``..''</b> are never matched,
    even if the pattern begins with a <b>``.''</b>. When not matching pathnames,
    the <b>``.''</b> character is not treated specially. When matching a
    pathname, the slash character must always be matched explicitly by a slash
    in the pattern, but in other matching contexts it can be matched by a
    special pattern character as described below under <b>Pattern Matching</b>.
    See the description of <b>shopt</b> below under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> for a description of the <b>nocaseglob</b>,
    <b>nullglob</b>, <b>globskipdots</b>, <b>failglob</b>, and <b>dotglob</b>
    shell options.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> shell variable may be used to
    restrict the set of file names matching a <i>pattern</i>. If
    <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> is set, each matching file name that also
    matches one of the patterns in <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> is removed
    from the list of matches. If the <b>nocaseglob</b> option is set, the
    matching against the patterns in <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> is
    performed without regard to case. The filenames <b>``.''</b> and
    <b>``..''</b> are always ignored when <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> is
    set and not null. However, setting <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> to a
    non-null value has the effect of enabling the <b>dotglob</b> shell option,
    so all other filenames beginning with a <b>``.''</b> will match. To get the
    old behavior of ignoring filenames beginning with a <b>``.''</b>, make
    <b>``.*''</b> one of the patterns in <b>GLOBIGNORE</b>. The <b>dotglob</b>
    option is disabled when <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> is unset. The
    pattern matching honors the setting of the <b>extglob</b> shell option.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Pattern Matching</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special
    pattern characters described below, matches itself. The NUL character may
    not occur in a pattern. A backslash escapes the following character; the
    escaping backslash is discarded when matching. The special pattern
    characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.</p>
<p class="Pp">The special pattern characters have the following meanings:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>Matches any string, including the null string. When the <b>globstar</b>
      shell option is enabled, and <b>*</b> is used in a pathname expansion
      context, two adjacent <b>*</b>s used as a single pattern will match all
      files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If followed by a
      <b>/</b>, two adjacent <b>*</b>s will match only directories and
      subdirectories.</dd>
  <dt><b>?</b></dt>
  <dd>Matches any single character.</dd>
  <dt><b>[...]</b></dt>
  <dd>Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of characters separated
      by a hyphen denotes a <i>range expression</i>; any character that falls
      between those two characters, inclusive, using the current locale's
      collating sequence and character set, is matched. If the first character
      following the <b>[</b> is a <b>!</b> or a <b>^</b> then any character not
      enclosed is matched. The sorting order of characters in range expressions,
      and the characters included in the range, are determined by the current
      locale and the values of the <small><b>LC_COLLATE</b></small> or
      <small><b>LC_ALL</b></small> shell variables, if set. To obtain the
      traditional interpretation of range expressions, where <b>[a-d]</b> is
      equivalent to <b>[abcd]</b>, set value of the <b>LC_ALL</b> shell variable
      to <b>C</b>, or enable the <b>globasciiranges</b> shell option. A <b>-</b>
      may be matched by including it as the first or last character in the set.
      A <b>]</b> may be matched by including it as the first character in the
      set.
    <p class="Pp">Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, <i>character classes</i> can be

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>alnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower print

<br/>
A character class matches any character belonging to that class. The <b>word</b>

    as the character <i>c</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, the syntax
    <b>[.</b><i>symbol</i><b>.]</b> matches the collating symbol
  <i>symbol</i>.</p>

<p class="Pp">If the <b>extglob</b> shell option is enabled using the
    <b>shopt</b> builtin, the shell recognizes several extended pattern matching
    operators. In the following description, a <i>pattern-list</i> is a list of
    one or more patterns separated by a <b>|</b>. Composite patterns may be
    formed using one or more of the following sub-patterns:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>?(</b><i>pattern-list</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns</dd>
  <dt><b>*(</b><i>pattern-list</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns</dd>
  <dt><b>+(</b><i>pattern-list</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns</dd>
  <dt><b>@(</b><i>pattern-list</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Matches one of the given patterns</dd>
  <dt><b>!(</b><i>pattern-list</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Matches anything except one of the given patterns</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The<b>extglob</b> option changes the behavior of the parser, since
    the parentheses are normally treated as operators with syntactic meaning. To
    ensure that extended matching patterns are parsed correctly, make sure that
    <b>extglob</b> is enabled before parsing constructs containing the patterns,
    including shell functions and command substitutions.</p>
<p class="Pp">When matching filenames, the <b>dotglob</b> shell option
    determines the set of filenames that are tested: when <b>dotglob</b> is
    enabled, the set of filenames includes all files beginning with ``.'', but
    ``.'' and ``..'' must be matched by a pattern or sub-pattern that begins
    with a dot; when it is disabled, the set does not include any filenames
    beginning with ``.'' unless the pattern or sub-pattern begins with a ``.''.
    As above, ``.'' only has a special meaning when matching filenames.</p>
<p class="Pp">Complicated extended pattern matching against long strings is
    slow, especially when the patterns contain alternations and the strings
    contain multiple matches. Using separate matches against shorter strings, or
    using arrays of strings instead of a single long string, may be faster.</p>

    <i>Redirection</i> allows commands' file handles to be duplicated, opened,

    the order they appear, from left to right.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number
    may instead be preceded by a word of the form {<i>varname</i>}. In this
    case, for each redirection operator except &gt;&amp;- and &lt;&amp;-, the
    shell will allocate a file descriptor greater than or equal to 10 and assign
    it to <i>varname</i>. If &gt;&amp;- or &lt;&amp;- is preceded by
    {<i>varname</i>}, the value of <i>varname</i> defines the file descriptor to
    close. If {<i>varname</i>} is supplied, the redirection persists beyond the
    scope of the command, allowing the shell programmer to manage the file
    descriptor's lifetime manually. The <b>varredir_close</b> shell option
    manages this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is
    omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <b>&lt;</b>,
    the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0). If the
    first character of the redirection operator is <b>&gt;</b>, the redirection
    refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The word following the redirection operator in the following
    descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion, tilde
    expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution,
    arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word splitting.
    If it expands to more than one word, <b>bash</b> reports an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the order of redirections is significant. For example,
    the command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">ls <b>&gt;</b> dirlist 2<b>&gt;&amp;</b>1</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">directs both standard output and standard error to the file
    <i>dirlist</i>, while the command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">ls 2<b>&gt;&amp;</b>1 <b>&gt;</b> dirlist</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">directs only the standard output to file <i>dirlist</i>, because
    the standard error was duplicated from the standard output before the
    standard output was redirected to <i>dirlist</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> handles several filenames specially when they are used
    in redirections, as described in the following table. If the operating
    system on which <b>bash</b> is running provides these special files, bash
    will use them; otherwise it will emulate them internally with the behavior
    described below.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>/dev/fd/<i>fd</i></b></dt>

<p class="Pp">A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to

<h1 class="Sh" id="ALIASES"><a class="permalink" href="#ALIASES">ALIASES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Aliases</i> allow a string to be substituted for a word when it
    is used as the first word of a simple command. The shell maintains a list of
    aliases that may be set and unset with the <b>alias</b> and <b>unalias</b>
    builtin commands (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below).
    The first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it
    has an alias. If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias. The
    characters <b>/</b>, <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, and <b>=</b> and any of the shell
    <i>metacharacters</i> or quoting characters listed above may not appear in
    an alias name. The replacement text may contain any valid shell input,
    including shell metacharacters. The first word of the replacement text is
    tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded
    is not expanded a second time. This means that one may alias <b>ls</b> to
    <b>ls -F</b>, for instance, and <b>bash</b> does not try to recursively
    expand the replacement text. If the last character of the alias value is a
    <i>blank</i>, then the next command word following the alias is also checked
    for alias expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Aliases are created and listed with the <b>alias</b> command, and
    removed with the <b>unalias</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.
    If arguments are needed, use a shell function (see
    <small><b>FUNCTIONS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless
    the <b>expand_aliases</b> shell option is set using <b>shopt</b> (see the
    description of <b>shopt</b> under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are
    somewhat confusing. <b>Bash</b> always reads at least one complete line of
    input, and all lines that make up a compound command, before executing any
    of the commands on that line or the compound command. Aliases are expanded
    when a command is read, not when it is executed. Therefore, an alias
    definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take
    effect until the next line of input is read. The commands following the
    alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias. This
    behavior is also an issue when functions are executed. Aliases are expanded
    when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed,
    because a function definition is itself a command. As a consequence, aliases
    defined in a function are not available until after that function is
    executed. To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and
    do not use <b>alias</b> in compound commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell
    functions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A shell function, defined as described above under <b>SHELL
    GRAMMAR</b>, stores a series of commands for later execution. When the name
    of a shell function is used as a simple command name, the list of commands
    associated with that function name is executed. Functions are executed in
    the context of the current shell; no new process is created to interpret
    them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script). When a function
    is executed, the arguments to the function become the positional parameters
    during its execution. The special parameter <b>#</b> is updated to reflect
    the change. Special parameter <b>0</b> is unchanged. The first element of
    the <small><b>FUNCNAME</b></small> variable is set to the name of the
    function while the function is executing.</p>
<p class="Pp">All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical
    between a function and its caller with these exceptions: the
    <small><b>DEBUG</b></small> and <b>RETURN</b> traps (see the description of
    the <b>trap</b> builtin under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small>
    below) are not inherited unless the function has been given the <b>trace</b>
    attribute (see the description of the <small><b>declare</b></small> builtin
    below) or the <b>-o functrace</b> shell option has been enabled with the
    <b>set</b> builtin (in which case all functions inherit the <b>DEBUG</b> and
    <b>RETURN</b> traps), and the <small><b>ERR</b></small> trap is not
    inherited unless the <b>-o errtrace</b> shell option has been enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">Variables local to the function may be declared with the
    <b>local</b> builtin command (<i>local variables</i>). Ordinarily, variables
    and their values are shared between the function and its caller. If a
    variable is declared <b>local</b>, the variable's visible scope is
    restricted to that function and its children (including the functions it
    calls).</p>
<p class="Pp">In the following description, the <i>current scope</i> is a
    currently- executing function. Previous scopes consist of that function's
    caller and so on, back to the &quot;global&quot; scope, where the shell is
    not executing any shell function. Consequently, a local variable at the
    current scope is a variable declared using the <b>local</b> or
    <b>declare</b> builtins in the function that is currently executing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Local variables &quot;shadow&quot; variables with the same name
    declared at previous scopes. For instance, a local variable declared in a
    function hides a global variable of the same name: references and
    assignments refer to the local variable, leaving the global variable
    unmodified. When the function returns, the global variable is once again
    visible.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell uses <i>dynamic scoping</i> to control a variable's
    visibility within functions. With dynamic scoping, visible variables and
    their values are a result of the sequence of function calls that caused
    execution to reach the current function. The value of a variable that a
    function sees depends on its value within its caller, if any, whether that
    caller is the &quot;global&quot; scope or another shell function. This is
    also the value that a local variable declaration &quot;shadows&quot;, and
    the value that is restored when the function returns.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if a variable <i>var</i> is declared as local in
    function <i>func1</i>, and <i>func1</i> calls another function <i>func2</i>,
    references to <i>var</i> made from within <i>func2</i> will resolve to the
    local variable <i>var</i> from <i>func1</i>, shadowing any global variable
    named <i>var</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>unset</b> builtin also acts using the same dynamic scope:
    if a variable is local to the current scope, <b>unset</b> will unset it;
    otherwise the unset will refer to the variable found in any calling scope as
    described above. If a variable at the current local scope is unset, it will
    remain so (appearing as unset) until it is reset in that scope or until the
    function returns. Once the function returns, any instance of the variable at
    a previous scope will become visible. If the unset acts on a variable at a
    previous scope, any instance of a variable with that name that had been
    shadowed will become visible (see below how the <b>localvar_unset</b> shell
    option changes this behavior).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>FUNCNEST</b> variable, if set to a numeric value greater
    than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level. Function invocations that
    exceed the limit cause the entire command to abort.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the builtin command <b>return</b> is executed in a function,
    the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the
    function call. Any command associated with the <b>RETURN</b> trap is
    executed before execution resumes. When a function completes, the values of
    the positional parameters and the special parameter <b>#</b> are restored to
    the values they had prior to the function's execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Function names and definitions may be listed with the <b>-f</b>
    option to the <b>declare</b> or <b>typeset</b> builtin commands. The
    <b>-F</b> option to <b>declare</b> or <b>typeset</b> will list the function
    names only (and optionally the source file and line number, if the
    <b>extdebug</b> shell option is enabled). Functions may be exported so that
    child shell processes (those created when executing a separate shell
    invocation) automatically have them defined with the <b>-f</b> option to the
    <b>export</b> builtin. A function definition may be deleted using the
    <b>-f</b> option to the <b>unset</b> builtin.</p>
<p class="Pp">Functions may be recursive. The <b>FUNCNEST</b> variable may be
    used to limit the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number
    of function invocations. By default, no limit is imposed on the number of
    recursive calls.</p>

<p class="Pp">Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is
    performed before the expression is evaluated. Within an expression, shell
    variables may also be referenced by name without using the parameter
    expansion syntax. A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when
    referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax. The value
    of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when it is
    referenced, or when a variable which has been given the <i>integer</i>
    attribute using <b>declare -i</b> is assigned a value. A null value
    evaluates to 0. A shell variable need not have its <i>integer</i> attribute
    turned on to be used in an expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">Integer constants follow the C language definition, without
    suffixes or character constants. Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted
    as octal numbers. A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal. Otherwise, numbers
    take the form [<i>base#</i>]n, where the optional <i>base</i> is a decimal
    number between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and <i>n</i> is a
    number in that base. If <i>base#</i> is omitted, then base 10 is used. When
    specifying <i>n</i>, if a non-digit is required, the digits greater than 9
    are represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _,
    in that order. If <i>base</i> is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and
    uppercase letters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between
    10 and 35.</p>
<p class="Pp">Operators are evaluated in order of precedence. Sub-expressions in
    parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules
  above.</p>

  EXPRESSIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Conditional expressions are used by the <b>[[</b> compound command
    and the <b>test</b> and <b>[</b> builtin commands to test file attributes
    and perform string and arithmetic comparisons. The <b>test</b> and <b>[</b>
    commands determine their behavior based on the number of arguments; see the
    descriptions of those commands for any other command-specific actions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Expressions are formed from the following unary or binary
    primaries. <b>Bash</b> handles several filenames specially when they are
    used in expressions. If the operating system on which <b>bash</b> is running
    provides these special files, bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate
    them internally with this behavior: If any <i>file</i> argument to one of
    the primaries is of the form <i>/dev/fd/n</i>, then file descriptor <i>n</i>
    is checked. If the <i>file</i> argument to one of the primaries is one of
    <i>/dev/stdin</i>, <i>/dev/stdout</i>, or <i>/dev/stderr</i>, file
    descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively, is checked.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow
    symbolic links and operate on the target of the link, rather than the link
    itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">When used with <b>[[</b>, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b>
    operators sort lexicographically using the current locale. The <b>test</b>
    command sorts using ASCII ordering.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SIMPLE_COMMAND_EXPANSION"><a class="permalink" href="#SIMPLE_COMMAND_EXPANSION">SIMPLE
  COMMAND EXPANSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the
    following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right, in
    the following order.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those
      preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later
      processing.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded.
      If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the
      name of the command and the remaining words are the arguments.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Redirections are performed as described above under
    <b>REDIRECTION</b>.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>The text after the <b>=</b> in each variable assignment undergoes tilde
      expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
      expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the variable.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the
    current shell environment. In the case of such a command (one that consists
    only of assignment statements and redirections), assignment statements are
    performed before redirections. Otherwise, the variables are added to the
    environment of the executed command and do not affect the current shell
    environment. If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a
    readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero
    status.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not
    affect the current shell environment. A redirection error causes the command
    to exit with a non-zero status.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is a command name left after expansion, execution
    proceeds as described below. Otherwise, the command exits. If one of the
    expansions contained a command substitution, the exit status of the command
    is the exit status of the last command substitution performed. If there were
    no command substitutions, the command exits with a status of zero.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMAND_EXECUTION"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND_EXECUTION">COMMAND
  EXECUTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">After a command has been split into words, if it results in a
    simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are
    taken.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to
    locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is
    invoked as described above in <b>FUNCTIONS</b>. If the name does not match a
    function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a
    match is found, that builtin is invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and
    contains no slashes, <b>bash</b> searches each element of the
    <small><b>PATH</b></small> for a directory containing an executable file by
    that name. <b>Bash</b> uses a hash table to remember the full pathnames of
    executable files (see <b>hash</b> under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below). A full search of the directories in
    <small><b>PATH</b></small> is performed only if the command is not found in
    the hash table. If the search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a
    defined shell function named <b>command_not_found_handle</b>. If that
    function exists, it is invoked in a separate execution environment with the
    original command and the original command's arguments as its arguments, and
    the function's exit status becomes the exit status of that subshell. If that
    function is not defined, the shell prints an error message and returns an
    exit status of 127.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one
    or more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate
    execution environment. Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the
    remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if
  any.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this execution fails because the file is not in executable
    format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a <i>shell
    script</i>, a file containing shell commands, and the shell creates a new
    instance of itself to execute it. This subshell reinitializes itself, so
    that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script,
    with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent
    (see <b>hash</b> below under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b>)</small>
    are retained by the child.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the program is a file beginning with <b>#!</b>, the remainder
    of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program. The shell
    executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle
    this executable format themselves. The arguments to the interpreter consist
    of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first
    line of the program, followed by the name of the program, followed by the
    command arguments, if any.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMAND_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT">COMMAND
  EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The shell has an <i>execution environment</i>, which consists of
    the following:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by
      redirections supplied to the <b>exec</b> builtin</li>
  <li>the current working directory as set by <b>cd</b>, <b>pushd</b>, or
      <b>popd</b>, or inherited by the shell at invocation</li>
  <li>the file creation mode mask as set by <b>umask</b> or inherited from the
      shell's parent</li>
  <li>current traps set by <b>trap</b></li>
  <li>shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with <b>set</b> or
      inherited from the shell's parent in the environment</li>
  <li>shell functions defined during execution or inherited from the shell's
      parent in the environment</li>
  <li>options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line
      arguments) or by <b>set</b></li>
  <li>options enabled by <b>shopt</b></li>
  <li>shell aliases defined with <b>alias</b></li>
  <li>various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value of
      <b>$$</b>, and the value of <small><b>PPID</b></small></li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to
    be executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment that consists
    of the following. Unless otherwise noted, the values are inherited from the
    shell.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>the shell's open files, plus any modifications and additions specified by
      redirections to the command</li>
  <li>the current working directory</li>
  <li>the file creation mode mask</li>
  <li>shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables
      exported for the command, passed in the environment</li>
  <li>traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the
      shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the
    shell's execution environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>subshell</i> is a copy of the shell process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and
    asynchronous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a
    duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps caught by the shell
    are reset to the values that the shell inherited from its parent at
    invocation. Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline are also
    executed in a subshell environment. Changes made to the subshell environment
    cannot affect the shell's execution environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">Subshells spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the
    value of the <b>-e</b> option from the parent shell. When not in <i>posix
    mode</i>, <b>bash</b> clears the <b>-e</b> option in such subshells.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a command is followed by a <b>&amp;</b> and job control is not
    active, the default standard input for the command is the empty file
    <i>/dev/null</i>. Otherwise, the invoked command inherits the file
    descriptors of the calling shell as modified by redirections.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called
    the <i>environment</i>. This is a list of <i>name</i>-<i>value</i> pairs, of
    the form <i>name=value</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On
    invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for
    each name found, automatically marking it for <i>export</i> to child
    processes. Executed commands inherit the environment. The <b>export</b> and
    <b>declare -x</b> commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and
    deleted from the environment. If the value of a parameter in the environment
    is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, replacing the
    old. The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the
    shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell, less
    any pairs removed by the <b>unset</b> command, plus any additions via the
    <b>export</b> and <b>declare -x</b> commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The environment for any <i>simple command</i> or function may be
    augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as
    described above in <b>PARAMETERS</b>. These assignment statements affect
    only the environment seen by that command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-k</b> option is set (see the <b>set</b> builtin command
    below), then <i>all</i> parameter assignments are placed in the environment
    for a command, not just those that precede the command name.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> invokes an external command, the variable
    <b>_</b> is set to the full filename of the command and passed to that
    command in its environment.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by
    the <i>waitpid</i> system call or equivalent function. Exit statuses fall
    between 0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may use values
    above 125 specially. Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands
    are also limited to this range. Under certain circumstances, the shell will
    use special values to indicate specific failure modes.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit
    status has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates success. A non-zero
    exit status indicates failure. When a command terminates on a fatal signal
    <i>N</i>, <b>bash</b> uses the value of 128+<i>N</i> as the exit status.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it
    returns a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable, the
    return status is 126.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a command fails because of an error during expansion or
    redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (<i>true</i>) if
    successful, and non-zero (<i>false</i>) if an error occurs while they
    execute. All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect
    usage, generally invalid options or missing arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exit status of the last command is available in the special
    parameter $?.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> itself returns the exit status of the last command
    executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a
    non-zero value. See also the <b>exit</b> builtin command below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="permalink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it
    ignores <small><b>SIGTERM</b></small> (so that <b>kill 0</b> does not kill
    an interactive shell), and <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> is caught and
    handled (so that the <b>wait</b> builtin is interruptible). In all cases,
    <b>bash</b> ignores <b>SIGQUIT</b>. If job control is in effect, <b>bash</b>
    ignores <b>SIGTTIN</b>, <b>SIGTTOU</b>, and <b>SIGTSTP</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Non-builtin commands run by <b>bash</b> have signal handlers set
    to the values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is
    not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> and
    <small><b>SIGQUIT</b></small> in addition to these inherited handlers.
    Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the
    keyboard-generated job control signals <b>SIGTTIN</b>, <b>SIGTTOU</b>, and
    <b>SIGTSTP</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell exits by default upon receipt of a <b>SIGHUP</b>. Before
    exiting, an interactive shell resends the <small><b>SIGHUP</b></small> to
    all jobs, running or stopped. Stopped jobs are sent
    <small><b>SIGCONT</b></small> to ensure that they receive the <b>SIGHUP</b>.
    To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, it should
    be removed from the jobs table with the <b>disown</b> builtin (see
    <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below) or marked to not receive
    <small><b>SIGHUP</b></small> using <b>disown -h</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>huponexit</b> shell option has been set with
    <b>shopt</b>, <b>bash</b> sends a <small><b>SIGHUP</b></small> to all jobs
    when an interactive login shell exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>bash</b> is waiting for a command to complete and receives a
    signal for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until
    the command completes. When <b>bash</b> is waiting for an asynchronous
    command via the <b>wait</b> builtin, the reception of a signal for which a
    trap has been set will cause the <b>wait</b> builtin to return immediately
    with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is
    executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">When job control is not enabled, and <b>bash</b> is waiting for a
    foreground command to complete, the shell receives keyboard-generated
    signals such as <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> (usually generated by
    <b>^C</b>) that users commonly intend to send to that command. This happens
    because the shell and the command are in the same process group as the
    terminal, and <b>^C</b> sends <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> to all processes
    in that process group.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> is running without job control enabled and
    receives <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> while waiting for a foreground
    command, it waits until that foreground command terminates and then decides
    what to do about the <b>SIGINT</b>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>If the command terminates due to the <b>SIGINT</b>, <b>bash</b> concludes
      that the user meant to end the entire script, and acts on the
      <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> (e.g., by running a
      <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> trap or exiting itself);</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>If the command does not terminate due to <b>SIGINT</b>, the program
      handled the <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> itself and did not treat it as a
      fatal signal. In that case, <b>bash</b> does not treat
      <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> as a fatal signal, either, instead assuming
      that the <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> was used as part of the program's
      normal operation (e.g., emacs uses it to abort editing commands) or
      deliberately discarded. However, <b>bash</b> will run any trap set on
      <b>SIGINT</b>, as it does with any other trapped signal it receives while
      it is waiting for the foreground command to complete, for
    compatibility.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="JOB_CONTROL"><a class="permalink" href="#JOB_CONTROL">JOB
  CONTROL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Job control</i> refers to the ability to selectively stop
    (<i>suspend</i>) the execution of processes and continue (<i>resume</i>)
    their execution at a later point. A user typically employs this facility via
    an interactive interface supplied jointly by the operating system kernel's
    terminal driver and <b>bash</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell associates a <i>job</i> with each pipeline. It keeps a
    table of currently executing jobs, which may be listed with the <b>jobs</b>
    command. When <b>bash</b> starts a job asynchronously (in the
    <i>background</i>), it prints a line that looks like:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">[1] 25647</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID
    of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647. All
    of the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job.
    <b>Bash</b> uses the <i>job</i> abstraction as the basis for job
  control.</p>
<p class="Pp">To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job
    control, the operating system maintains the notion of a <i>current
    terminal</i> <i>process group ID</i>. Members of this process group
    (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current terminal process
    group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as <b>SIGINT</b>. These
    processes are said to be in the <i>foreground</i>. <i>Background</i>
    processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's; such
    processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals. Only foreground
    processes are allowed to read from or, if the user so specifies with
    <span class="Li">stty tostop</span>, write to the terminal. Background
    processes which attempt to read from (write to when <span class="Li">stty
    tostop</span> is in effect) the terminal are sent a <small><b>SIGTTIN
    (SIGTTOU)</b></small> signal by the kernel's terminal driver, which, unless
    caught, suspends the process.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the operating system on which <b>bash</b> is running supports
    job control, <b>bash</b> contains facilities to use it. Typing the
    <i>suspend</i> character (typically <b>^Z</b>, Control-Z) while a process is
    running causes that process to be stopped and returns control to
    <b>bash</b>. Typing the <i>delayed suspend</i> character (typically
    <b>^Y</b>, Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it attempts to
    read input from the terminal, and control to be returned to <b>bash</b>. The
    user may then manipulate the state of this job, using the <b>bg</b> command
    to continue it in the background, the <b>fg</b> command to continue it in
    the foreground, or the <b>kill</b> command to kill it. A <b>^Z</b> takes
    effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing pending
    output and typeahead to be discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell. The
    character <b>%</b> introduces a job specification (<i>jobspec</i>). Job
    number <i>n</i> may be referred to as <b>%n</b>. A job may also be referred
    to using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that
    appears in its command line. For example, <b>%ce</b> refers to a stopped job
    whose command name begins with <b>ce</b>. If a prefix matches more than one
    job, <b>bash</b> reports an error. Using <b>%?ce</b>, on the other hand,
    refers to any job containing the string <b>ce</b> in its command line. If
    the substring matches more than one job, <b>bash</b> reports an error. The
    symbols <b>%%</b> and <b>%+</b> refer to the shell's notion of the
    <i>current job</i>, which is the last job stopped while it was in the
    foreground or started in the background. The <i>previous job</i> may be
    referenced using <b>%-</b>. If there is only a single job, <b>%+</b> and
    <b>%-</b> can both be used to refer to that job. In output pertaining to
    jobs (e.g., the output of the <b>jobs</b> command), the current job is
    always flagged with a <b>+</b>, and the previous job with a <b>-</b>. A
    single % (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the current
    job.</p>
<p class="Pp">Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground:
    <b>%1</b> is a synonym for <b>``fg %1''</b>, bringing job 1 from the
    background into the foreground. Similarly, <b>``%1 &amp;''</b> resumes job 1
    in the background, equivalent to <b>``bg %1''</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state.
    Normally, <b>bash</b> waits until it is about to print a prompt before
    reporting changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output.
    If the <b>-b</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command is enabled,
    <b>bash</b> reports such changes immediately. Any trap on
    <small><b>SIGCHLD</b></small> is executed for each child that exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an attempt to exit <b>bash</b> is made while jobs are stopped
    (or, if the <b>checkjobs</b> shell option has been enabled using the
    <b>shopt</b> builtin, running), the shell prints a warning message, and, if
    the <b>checkjobs</b> option is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses.
    The <b>jobs</b> command may then be used to inspect their status. If a
    second attempt to exit is made without an intervening command, the shell
    does not print another warning, and any stopped jobs are terminated.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the shell is waiting for a job or process using the
    <b>wait</b> builtin, and job control is enabled, <b>wait</b> will return
    when the job changes state. The <b>-f</b> option causes <b>wait</b> to wait
    until the job or process terminates before returning.</p>

<p class="Pp">The command number and the history number are usually different:

    position in the sequence of commands executed during the current shell

    expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal,
    subject to the value of the <b>promptvars</b> shell option (see the

<h1 class="Sh" id="READLINE"><a class="permalink" href="#READLINE">READLINE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This is the library that handles reading input when using an
    interactive shell, unless the <b>--noediting</b> option is given at shell
    invocation. Line editing is also used when using the <b>-e</b> option to the
    <b>read</b> builtin. By default, the line editing commands are similar to
    those of Emacs. A vi-style line editing interface is also available. Line
    editing can be enabled at any time using the <b>-o emacs</b> or <b>-o vi</b>
    options to the <b>set</b> builtin (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below). To turn off line editing after the shell is
    running, use the <b>+o emacs</b> or <b>+o vi</b> options to the <b>set</b>
    builtin.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Readline_Notation"><a class="permalink" href="#Readline_Notation">Readline
  Notation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In this section, the Emacs-style notation is used to denote
    keystrokes. Control keys are denoted by C-<i>key</i>, e.g., C-n means
    Control-N. Similarly, <i>meta</i> keys are denoted by M-<i>key</i>, so M-x
    means Meta-X. (On keyboards without a <i>meta</i> key, M-<i>x</i> means ESC
    <i>x</i>, i.e., press the Escape key then the <i>x</i> key. This makes ESC
    the <i>meta prefix</i>. The combination M-C-<i>x</i> means
    ESC-Control-<i>x</i>, or press the Escape key then hold the Control key
    while pressing the <i>x</i> key.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Readline commands may be given numeric <i>arguments</i>, which
    normally act as a repeat count. Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the
    argument that is significant. Passing a negative argument to a command that
    acts in the forward direction (e.g., <b>kill-line</b>) causes that command
    to act in a backward direction. Commands whose behavior with arguments
    deviates from this are noted below.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a command is described as <i>killing</i> text, the text
    deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (<i>yanking</i>). The killed
    text is saved in a <i>kill ring</i>. Consecutive kills cause the text to be
    accumulated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once. Commands which
    do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Readline_Initialization"><a class="permalink" href="#Readline_Initialization">Readline
  Initialization</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization
    file (the <i>inputrc</i> file). The name of this file is taken from the
    value of the <small><b>INPUTRC</b></small> variable. If that variable is
    unset, the default is <i>~/.inputrc</i>. If that file does not exist or
    cannot be read, the ultimate default is <i>/etc/inputrc</i>. When a program
    which uses the readline library starts up, the initialization file is read,
    and the key bindings and variables are set. There are only a few basic
    constructs allowed in the readline initialization file. Blank lines are
    ignored. Lines beginning with a <b>#</b> are comments. Lines beginning with
    a <b>$</b> indicate conditional constructs. Other lines denote key bindings
    and variable settings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default key-bindings may be changed with an <i>inputrc</i>
    file. Other programs that use this library may add their own commands and
    bindings.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, placing</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">M-Control-u: universal-argument</p>
</div>
or
<div class="Bd-indent">C-Meta-u: universal-argument</div>
into the <i>inputrc</i> would make M-C-u execute the readline command
  <i>universal-argument</i>.
<p class="Pp">The following symbolic character names are recognized:
    <i>RUBOUT</i>, <i>DEL</i>, <i>ESC</i>, <i>LFD</i>, <i>NEWLINE</i>,
    <i>RET</i>, <i>RETURN</i>, <i>SPC</i>, <i>SPACE</i>, and <i>TAB</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to
    a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <i>macro</i>).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Readline_Key_Bindings"><a class="permalink" href="#Readline_Key_Bindings">Readline
  Key Bindings</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The syntax for controlling key bindings in the <i>inputrc</i> file
    is simple. All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a
    macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound. The name may be
    specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with
    <i>Meta-</i> or <i>Control-</i> prefixes, or as a key sequence.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the form <b>keyname</b>:<i>function-name</i> or
    <i>macro</i>, <i>keyname</i> is the name of a key spelled out in English.
    For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Control-u: universal-argument
<br/>
Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
<br/>
Control-o: &quot;&gt; output&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp">In the above example, <i>C-u</i> is bound to the function
    <b>universal-argument</b>, <i>M-DEL</i> is bound to the function
    <b>backward-kill-word</b>, and <i>C-o</i> is bound to run the macro
    expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text ``&gt;
    output'' into the line).</p>
<p class="Pp">In the second form, <b>&quot;keyseq&quot;</b>:<i>function-name</i>
    or <i>macro</i>, <b>keyseq</b> differs from <b>keyname</b> above in that
    strings denoting an entire key sequence may be specified by placing the
    sequence within double quotes. Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used,
    as in the following example, but the symbolic character names are not
    recognized.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;\C-u&quot;: universal-argument
<br/>
&quot;\C-x\C-r&quot;: re-read-init-file
<br/>
&quot;\e[11~&quot;: &quot;Function Key 1&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp">In this example, <i>C-u</i> is again bound to the function
    <b>universal-argument</b>. <i>C-x C-r</i> is bound to the function
    <b>re-read-init-file</b>, and <i>ESC [ 1 1 ~</i> is bound to insert the text
    ``Function Key 1''.</p>
<p class="Pp">The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is</p>

</div>
<p class="Pp">When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be
    used to indicate a macro definition. Unquoted text is assumed to be a

  Conditional Constructs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the
    conditional compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key
    bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result of tests. There
    are four parser directives used.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>$if</b></dt>
  <dd>The <b>$if</b> construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing
      mode, the terminal being used, or the application using readline. The text
      of the test, after any comparison operator,
    <br/>
     extends to the end of the line; unless otherwise noted, no characters are
      required to isolate it.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="mode"><a class="permalink" href="#mode"><b>mode</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>mode=</b> form of the <b>$if</b> directive is used to test whether
      readline is in emacs or vi mode. This may be used in conjunction with the
      <b>set keymap</b> command, for instance, to set bindings in the
      <i>emacs-standard</i> and <i>emacs-ctlx</i> keymaps only if readline is
      starting out in emacs mode.</dd>
  <dt id="term"><a class="permalink" href="#term"><b>term</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>term=</b> form may be used to include terminal-specific key
      bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the terminal's
      function keys. The word on the right side of the <b>=</b> is tested
      against both the full name of the terminal and the portion of the terminal
      name before the first <b>-</b>. This allows <i>sun</i> to match both
      <i>sun</i> and <i>sun-cmd</i>, for instance.</dd>
  <dt><b>version</b></dt>
  <dd>The <b>version</b> test may be used to perform comparisons against
      specific readline versions. The <b>version</b> expands to the current
      readline version. The set of comparison operators includes <b>=</b>, (and
      <b>==</b>), <b>!=</b>, <b>&lt;=</b>, <b>&gt;=</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, and
      <b>&gt;</b>. The version number supplied on the right side of the operator
      consists of a major version number, an optional decimal point, and an
      optional minor version (e.g., <b>7.1</b>). If the minor version is
      omitted, it is assumed to be <b>0</b>. The operator may be separated from
      the string <b>version</b> and from the version number argument by
      whitespace.</dd>
  <dt id="application"><a class="permalink" href="#application"><b>application</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>application</b> construct is used to include application-specific
      settings. Each program using the readline library sets the <i>application
      name</i>, and an initialization file can test for a particular value. This
      could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for a specific
      program. For instance, the following command adds a key sequence that
      quotes the current or previous word in <b>bash</b>:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>$if</b> Bash
# Quote the current or previous word
&quot;\C-xq&quot;: &quot;\eb\&quot;\ef\&quot;&quot;
<b>$endif</b></pre>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>variable</i></dt>
  <dd>The <i>variable</i> construct provides simple equality tests for readline
      variables and values. The permitted comparison operators are <i>=</i>,
      <i>==</i>, and <i>!=</i>. The variable name must be separated from the
      comparison operator by whitespace; the operator may be separated from the
      value on the right hand side by whitespace. Both string and boolean
      variables may be tested. Boolean variables must be tested against the
      values <i>on</i> and <i>off</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>$endif</b></dt>
  <dd>This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an <b>$if</b>

  <dt><b>$else</b></dt>
  <dd>Commands in this branch of the <b>$if</b> directive are executed if the
      test fails.</dd>
  <dt><b>$include</b></dt>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Searching"><a class="permalink" href="#Searching">Searching</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Readline provides commands for searching through the command
    history (see <small><b>HISTORY</b></small> below) for lines containing a
    specified string. There are two search modes: <i>incremental</i> and
    <i>non-incremental</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the
    search string. As each character of the search string is typed, readline
    displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far.
    An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to find the
    desired history entry. The characters present in the value of the
    <b>isearch-terminators</b> variable are used to terminate an incremental
    search. If that variable has not been assigned a value the Escape and
    Control-J characters will terminate an incremental search. Control-G will
    abort an incremental search and restore the original line. When the search
    is terminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes the
    current line.</p>
<p class="Pp">To find other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S
    or Control-R as appropriate. This will search backward or forward in the
    history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far. Any
    other key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the search and
    execute that command. For instance, a <i>newline</i> will terminate the
    search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from the history
    list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Readline remembers the last incremental search string. If two
    Control-Rs are typed without any intervening characters defining a new
    search string, any remembered search string is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before
    starting to search for matching history lines. The search string may be
    typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Programmable_Completion"><a class="permalink" href="#Programmable_Completion">Programmable
  Completion</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When word completion is attempted for an argument to a command for
    which a completion specification (a <i>compspec</i>) has been defined using
    the <b>complete</b> builtin (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below), the programmable completion facilities are
    invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, the command name is identified. If the command word is the
    empty string (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line), any
    compspec defined with the <b>-E</b> option to <b>complete</b> is used. If a
    compspec has been defined for that command, the compspec is used to generate
    the list of possible completions for the word. If the command word is a full
    pathname, a compspec for the full pathname is searched for first. If no
    compspec is found for the full pathname, an attempt is made to find a
    compspec for the portion following the final slash. If those searches do not
    result in a compspec, any compspec defined with the <b>-D</b> option to
    <b>complete</b> is used as the default. If there is no default compspec,
    <b>bash</b> attempts alias expansion on the command word as a final resort,
    and attempts to find a compspec for the command word from any successful
    expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the list of
    matching words. If a compspec is not found, the default <b>bash</b>
    completion as described above under <b>Completing</b> is performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, the actions specified by the compspec are used. Only
    matches which are prefixed by the word being completed are returned. When
    the <b>-f</b> or <b>-d</b> option is used for filename or directory name
    completion, the shell variable <small><b>FIGNORE</b></small> is used to
    filter the matches.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any completions specified by a pathname expansion pattern to the
    <b>-G</b> option are generated next. The words generated by the pattern need
    not match the word being completed. The <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small>
    shell variable is not used to filter the matches, but the
    <small><b>FIGNORE</b></small> variable is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Next, the string specified as the argument to the <b>-W</b> option
    is considered. The string is first split using the characters in the
    <small><b>IFS</b></small> special variable as delimiters. Shell quoting is
    honored. Each word is then expanded using brace expansion, tilde expansion,
    parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
    expansion, as described above under <b>EXPANSION</b>. The results are split
    using the rules described above under <b>Word Splitting</b>. The results of
    the expansion are prefix-matched against the word being completed, and the
    matching words become the possible completions.</p>
<p class="Pp">After these matches have been generated, any shell function or
    command specified with the <b>-F</b> and <b>-C</b> options is invoked. When
    the command or function is invoked, the <b>COMP_LINE</b>, <b>COMP_POINT</b>,
    <b>COMP_KEY</b>, and <small><b>COMP_TYPE</b></small> variables are assigned
    values as described above under <b>Shell Variables</b>. If a shell function
    is being invoked, the <small><b>COMP_WORDS</b></small> and
    <small><b>COMP_CWORD</b></small> variables are also set. When the function
    or command is invoked, the first argument (<b>$1</b>) is the name of the
    command whose arguments are being completed, the second argument (<b>$2</b>)
    is the word being completed, and the third argument (<b>$3</b>) is the word
    preceding the word being completed on the current command line. No filtering
    of the generated completions against the word being completed is performed;
    the function or command has complete freedom in generating the matches.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any function specified with <b>-F</b> is invoked first. The
    function may use any of the shell facilities, including the <b>compgen</b>
    builtin described below, to generate the matches. It must put the possible
    completions in the <small><b>COMPREPLY</b></small> array variable, one per
    array element.</p>
<p class="Pp">Next, any command specified with the <b>-C</b> option is invoked
    in an environment equivalent to command substitution. It should print a list
    of completions, one per line, to the standard output. Backslash may be used
    to escape a newline, if necessary.</p>
<p class="Pp">After all of the possible completions are generated, any filter
    specified with the <b>-X</b> option is applied to the list. The filter is a
    pattern as used for pathname expansion; a <b>&amp;</b> in the pattern is
    replaced with the text of the word being completed. A literal <b>&amp;</b>
    may be escaped with a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting
    a match. Any completion that matches the pattern will be removed from the
    list. A leading <b>!</b> negates the pattern; in this case any completion
    not matching the pattern will be removed. If the <b>nocasematch</b> shell
    option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of
    alphabetic characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the <b>-P</b> and
    <b>-S</b> options are added to each member of the completion list, and the
    result is returned to the readline completion code as the list of possible
    completions.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and
    the <b>-o dirnames</b> option was supplied to <b>complete</b> when the
    compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-o plusdirs</b> option was supplied to <b>complete</b>
    when the compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted and
    any matches are added to the results of the other actions.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is
    returned to the completion code as the full set of possible completions. The
    default <b>bash</b> completions are not attempted, and the readline default
    of filename completion is disabled. If the <b>-o bashdefault</b> option was
    supplied to <b>complete</b> when the compspec was defined, the <b>bash</b>
    default completions are attempted if the compspec generates no matches. If
    the <b>-o default</b> option was supplied to <b>complete</b> when the
    compspec was defined, readline's default completion will be performed if the
    compspec (and, if attempted, the default <b>bash</b> completions) generate
    no matches.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a compspec indicates that directory name completion is
    desired, the programmable completion functions force readline to append a
    slash to completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject to
    the value of the <b>mark-directories</b> readline variable, regardless of
    the setting of the <b>mark-symlinked-directories</b> readline variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is some support for dynamically modifying completions. This
    is most useful when used in combination with a default completion specified
    with <b>complete -D</b>. It's possible for shell functions executed as
    completion handlers to indicate that completion should be retried by
    returning an exit status of 124. If a shell function returns 124, and
    changes the compspec associated with the command on which completion is
    being attempted (supplied as the first argument when the function is
    executed), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an
    attempt to find a new compspec for that command. This allows a set of
    completions to be built dynamically as completion is attempted, rather than
    being loaded all at once.</p>
<p class="Pp">For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each
    kept in a file corresponding to the name of the command, the following
    default completion function would load completions dynamically:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">_completion_loader()</span>
  <br/>
  {
  <br/>
  	. &quot;/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh&quot; &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
    &amp;&amp; return 124
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default
  <br/>
  <span class="Li"></span></p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>-o history</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin is
    enabled, the shell provides access to the <i>command history</i>, the list
    of commands previously typed. The value of the
    <small><b>HISTSIZE</b></small> variable is used as the number of commands to
    save in a history list. The text of the last <small><b>HISTSIZE</b></small>
    commands (default 500) is saved. The shell stores each command in the
    history list prior to parameter and variable expansion (see
    <small><b>EXPANSION</b></small> above) but after history expansion is
    performed, subject to the values of the shell variables
    <small><b>HISTIGNORE</b></small> and <b>HISTCONTROL</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the
    variable <small><b>HISTFILE</b></small> (default <i>~/.bash_history</i>).
    The file named by the value of <small><b>HISTFILE</b></small> is truncated,
    if necessary, to contain no more than the number of lines specified by the
    value of <b>HISTFILESIZE</b>. If <b>HISTFILESIZE</b> is unset, or set to
    null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than zero, the history
    file is not truncated. When the history file is read, lines beginning with
    the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are
    interpreted as timestamps for the following history line. These timestamps
    are optionally displayed depending on the value of the
    <small><b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b></small> variable. When a shell with history
    enabled exits, the last <small><b>$HISTSIZE</b></small> lines are copied
    from the history list to <b>$HISTFILE</b>. If the <b>histappend</b> shell
    option is enabled (see the description of <b>shopt</b> under <small><b>SHELL
    BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below), the lines are appended to the history
    file, otherwise the history file is overwritten. If
    <small><b>HISTFILE</b></small> is unset, or if the history file is
    unwritable, the history is not saved. If the
    <small><b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b></small> variable is set, time stamps are
    written to the history file, marked with the history comment character, so
    they may be preserved across shell sessions. This uses the history comment
    character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines. After saving
    the history, the history file is truncated to contain no more than
    <small><b>HISTFILESIZE</b></small> lines. If
    <small><b>HISTFILESIZE</b></small> is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric
    value, or a numeric value less than zero, the history file is not
  truncated.</p>
<p class="Pp">The builtin command <b>fc</b> (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below) may be used to list or edit and re-execute a
    portion of the history list. The <b>history</b> builtin may be used to
    display or modify the history list and manipulate the history file. When
    using command-line editing, search commands are available in each editing
    mode that provide access to the history list.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the
    history list. The <small><b>HISTCONTROL</b></small> and
    <small><b>HISTIGNORE</b></small> variables may be set to cause the shell to
    save only a subset of the commands entered. The <b>cmdhist</b> shell option,
    if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a multi-line
    command in the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary to
    preserve syntactic correctness. The <b>lithist</b> shell option causes the
    shell to save the command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons. See
    the description of the <b>shopt</b> builtin below under <small><b>SHELL
    BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> for information on setting and unsetting shell
    options.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY_EXPANSION"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY_EXPANSION">HISTORY
  EXPANSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to
    the history expansion in <b>csh</b>. This section describes what syntax
    features are available. This feature is enabled by default for interactive
    shells, and can be disabled using the <b>+H</b> option to the <b>set</b>
    builtin command (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below).
    Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">History expansions introduce words from the history list into the
    input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a
    previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous
    commands quickly.</p>
<p class="Pp">History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line
    is read, before the shell breaks it into words, and is performed on each
    line individually without taking quoting on previous lines into account. It
    takes place in two parts. The first is to determine which line from the
    history list to use during substitution. The second is to select portions of
    that line for inclusion into the current one. The line selected from the
    history is the <i>event</i>, and the portions of that line that are acted
    upon are <i>words</i>. Various <i>modifiers</i> are available to manipulate
    the selected words. The line is broken into words in the same fashion as
    when reading input, so that several <i>metacharacter</i>-separated words
    surrounded by quotes are considered one word. History expansions are
    introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is
    <b>!</b> by default. Only backslash (<b>\</b>) and single quotes can quote
    the history expansion character, but the history expansion character is also
    treated as quoted if it immediately precedes the closing double quote in a
    double-quoted string.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately
    following the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: space,
    tab, newline, carriage return, and <b>=</b>. If the <b>extglob</b> shell
    option is enabled, <b>(</b> will also inhibit expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several shell options settable with the <b>shopt</b> builtin may
    be used to tailor the behavior of history expansion. If the
    <b>histverify</b> shell option is enabled (see the description of the
    <b>shopt</b> builtin below), and <b>readline</b> is being used, history
    substitutions are not immediately passed to the shell parser. Instead, the
    expanded line is reloaded into the <b>readline</b> editing buffer for
    further modification. If <b>readline</b> is being used, and the
    <b>histreedit</b> shell option is enabled, a failed history substitution
    will be reloaded into the <b>readline</b> editing buffer for correction. The
    <b>-p</b> option to the <b>history</b> builtin command may be used to see
    what a history expansion will do before using it. The <b>-s</b> option to
    the <b>history</b> builtin may be used to add commands to the end of the
    history list without actually executing them, so that they are available for
    subsequent recall.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell allows control of the various characters used by the
    history expansion mechanism (see the description of <b>histchars</b> above
    under <b>Shell Variables</b>). The shell uses the history comment character
    to mark history timestamps when writing the history file.</p>

      environment and return the exit status of the last command executed from
      <i>filename</i>. If <i>filename</i> does not contain a slash, filenames in
      <small><b>PATH</b></small> are used to find the directory containing
      <i>filename</i>, but <i>filename</i> does not need to be executable. The
      file searched for in <small><b>PATH</b></small> need not be executable.
      When <b>bash</b> is not in <i>posix mode</i>, it searches the current
      directory if no file is found in <b>PATH</b>. If the <b>sourcepath</b>
      option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin command is turned off, the
      <small><b>PATH</b></small> is not searched. If any <i>arguments</i> are
      supplied, they become the positional parameters when <i>filename</i> is
      executed. Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged. If the
      <b>-T</b> option is enabled, <b>.</b> inherits any trap on <b>DEBUG</b>;
      if it is not, any <b>DEBUG</b> trap string is saved and restored around
      the call to <b>.</b>, and <b>.</b> unsets the <b>DEBUG</b> trap while it
      executes. If <b>-T</b> is not set, and the sourced file changes the
      <b>DEBUG</b> trap, the new value is retained when <b>.</b> completes. The
      return status is the status of the last command exited within the script
      (0 if no commands are executed), and false if <i>filename</i> is not found
      or cannot be read.</dd>

  <dd><b>Alias</b> with no arguments or with the <b>-p</b> option prints the

      standard output. When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each
      <i>name</i> whose <i>value</i> is given. A trailing space in <i>value</i>
      causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias
      is expanded. For each <i>name</i> in the argument list for which no
      <i>value</i> is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed.
      <b>Alias</b> returns true unless a <i>name</i> is given for which no alias

      the value of the <small><b>HOME</b></small> shell variable is the default.
      The variable <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> defines the search path for the

      <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> is searched for <i>dir</i>. Alternative
      directory names in <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> are separated by a colon
      (:). A null directory name in <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> is the same as
      the current directory, i.e., ``<b>.</b>''. If <i>dir</i> begins with a
      slash (/), then <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> is not used. The <b>-P</b>
      option causes <b>cd</b> to use the physical directory structure by
      resolving symbolic links while traversing <i>dir</i> and before processing
      instances of <i>..</i> in <i>dir</i> (see also the <b>-P</b> option to the
      <b>set</b> builtin command); the <b>-L</b> option forces symbolic links to
      be followed by resolving the link after processing instances of <i>..</i>
      in <i>dir</i>. If <i>..</i> appears in <i>dir</i>, it is processed by
      removing the immediately previous pathname component from <i>dir</i>, back
      to a slash or the beginning of <i>dir</i>. If the <b>-e</b> option is
      supplied with <b>-P</b>, and the current working directory cannot be
      successfully determined after a successful directory change, <b>cd</b>
      will return an unsuccessful status. On systems that support it, the
      <b>-@</b> option presents the extended attributes associated with a file
      as a directory. An argument of <b>-</b> is converted to
      <small><b>$OLDPWD</b></small> before the directory change is attempted. If
      a non-empty directory name from <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> is used, or
      if <b>-</b> is the first argument, and the directory change is successful,
      the absolute pathname of the new working directory is written to the
      standard output. If the directory change is successful, <b>cd</b> sets the
      value of the <b>PWD</b> environment variable to the new directory name,
      and sets the <b>OLDPWD</b> environment variable to the value of the
      current working directory before the change. The return value is true if
      the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.</dd>

      utilities. If either the <b>-V</b> or <b>-v</b> option is supplied, a
      description of <i>command</i> is printed. The <b>-v</b> option causes a
      single word indicating the command or filename used to invoke
      <i>command</i> to be displayed; the <b>-V</b> option produces a more
      verbose description. If the <b>-V</b> or <b>-v</b> option is supplied, the

      option is supplied and an error occurred or <i>command</i> cannot be

      without specifying a full pathname, even though the shell normally
      searches for builtins before disk commands. If <b>-n</b> is used, each

      to use the <b>test</b> binary found via the <small><b>PATH</b></small>
      instead of the shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test''. The
      <b>-f</b> option means to load the new builtin command <i>name</i> from
      shared object <i>filename</i>, on systems that support dynamic loading.
      Bash will use the value of the <b>BASH_LOADABLES_PATH</b> variable as a
      colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
      <i>filename</i>. The default is system-dependent. The <b>-d</b> option
      will delete a builtin previously loaded with <b>-f</b>. If no <i>name</i>

      consists of all enabled shell builtins. If <b>-n</b> is supplied, only

      includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is
      enabled. If <b>-s</b> is supplied, the output is restricted to the POSIX

      of the zeroth argument passed to <i>command</i>. This is what

      the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the

      is equivalent to -1 and -0 is equivalent to the current command (usually
      the <b>fc</b> command); otherwise 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is invalid.
      If <i>last</i> is not specified, it is set to the current command for
      listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10 commands) and to
      <i>first</i> otherwise. If <i>first</i> is not specified, it is set to the

        <b>-l</b> option is given, the commands are listed on standard output.
        Otherwise, the editor given by <i>ename</i> is invoked on a file

  <dd><b>getopts</b> is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters.
      <i>optstring</i> contains the option characters to be recognized; if a
      character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an
      argument, which should be separated from it by white space. The colon and
      question mark characters may not be used as option characters. Each time
      it is invoked, <b>getopts</b> places the next option in the shell variable
      <i>name</i>, initializing <i>name</i> if it does not exist, and the index
      of the next argument to be processed into the variable <b>OPTIND</b>.
      <small><b>OPTIND</b></small> is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a
      shell script is invoked. When an option requires an argument,
      <b>getopts</b> places that argument into the variable <b>OPTARG</b>. The
      shell does not reset <small><b>OPTIND</b></small> automatically; it must
      be manually reset between multiple calls to <b>getopts</b> within the same
      shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.
    <p class="Pp">When the end of options is encountered, <b>getopts</b> exits
        with a return value greater than zero. <small><b>OPTIND</b></small> is
        set to the index of the first non-option argument, and <i>name</i> is
        set to ?.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>getopts</b> normally parses the positional parameters, but
        if more arguments are supplied as <i>arg</i> values, <b>getopts</b>
        parses those instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>getopts</b> can report errors in two ways. If the first
        character of <i>optstring</i> is a colon, <i>silent</i> error reporting
        is used. In normal operation, diagnostic messages are printed when
        invalid options or missing option arguments are encountered. If the
        variable <small><b>OPTERR</b></small> is set to 0, no error messages
        will be displayed, even if the first character of <i>optstring</i> is
        not a colon.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If an invalid option is seen, <b>getopts</b> places ? into
        <i>name</i> and, if not silent, prints an error message and unsets
        <b>OPTARG</b>. If <b>getopts</b> is silent, the option character found

    <p class="Pp">The <i>format</i> is a character string which contains three

  <dd>causes <b>printf</b> to output the date-time string resulting from using
      <i>datefmt</i> as a format string for <i>strftime</i>(3). The

      seconds since the epoch. Two special argument values may be used: -1
      represents the current time, and -2 represents the time the shell was

      given. This is an exception to the usual <b>printf</b> behavior.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The %b, %q, and %T directives all use the field width and
    precision arguments from the format specification and write that many bytes

    contains more characters than the original.</p>
<p class="Pp">Arguments to non-string format specifiers are treated as C
    constants, except that a leading plus or minus sign is allowed, and if the
    leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the ASCII value
    of the following character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>format</i> is reused as necessary to consume all of the
    <i>arguments</i>. If the <i>format</i> requires more <i>arguments</i> than
    are supplied, the extra format specifications behave as if a zero value or

<h1 class="Sh" id="SHELL_COMPATIBILITY_MODE"><a class="permalink" href="#SHELL_COMPATIBILITY_MODE">SHELL
  COMPATIBILITY MODE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Bash-4.0 introduced the concept of a <i>shell compatibility
    level</i>, specified as a set of options to the shopt builtin (
    <b>compat31</b>, <b>compat32</b>, <b>compat40</b>, <b>compat41</b>, and so
    on). There is only one current compatibility level -- each option is
    mutually exclusive. The compatibility level is intended to allow users to
    select behavior from previous versions that is incompatible with newer
    versions while they migrate scripts to use current features and behavior.
    It's intended to be a temporary solution.</p>
<p class="Pp">This section does not mention behavior that is standard for a
    particular version (e.g., setting <b>compat32</b> means that quoting the rhs
    of the regexp matching operator quotes special regexp characters in the
    word, which is default behavior in bash-3.2 and subsequent versions).</p>
<p class="Pp">If a user enables, say, <b>compat32</b>, it may affect the
    behavior of other compatibility levels up to and including the current
    compatibility level. The idea is that each compatibility level controls
    behavior that changed in that version of <b>bash</b>, but that behavior may
    have been present in earlier versions. For instance, the change to use
    locale-based comparisons with the <b>[[</b> command came in bash-4.1, and
    earlier versions used ASCII-based comparisons, so enabling <b>compat32</b>
    will enable ASCII-based comparisons as well. That granularity may not be
    sufficient for all uses, and as a result users should employ compatibility
    levels carefully. Read the documentation for a particular feature to find
    out the current behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bash-4.3 introduced a new shell variable: <b>BASH_COMPAT</b>. The
    value assigned to this variable (a decimal version number like 4.2, or an
    integer corresponding to the <b>compat</b><i>NN</i> option, like 42)
    determines the compatibility level.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with bash-4.4, Bash has begun deprecating older
    compatibility levels. Eventually, the options will be removed in favor of
    <b>BASH_COMPAT</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bash-5.0 is the final version for which there will be an
    individual shopt option for the previous version. Users should use
    <small><b>BASH_COMPAT</b></small> on bash-5.0 and later versions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following table describes the behavior changes controlled by
    each compatibility level setting. The <b>compat</b><i>NN</i> tag is used as
    shorthand for setting the compatibility level to <i>NN</i> using one of the
    following mechanisms. For versions prior to bash-5.0, the compatibility
    level may be set using the corresponding <b>compat</b><i>NN</i> shopt
    option. For bash-4.3 and later versions, the
    <small><b>BASH_COMPAT</b></small> variable is preferred, and it is required
    for bash-5.1 and later versions.</p>

  REPORTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you find a bug in <b>bash,</b> you should report it. But first,
    you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the
    latest version of <b>bash</b>. The latest version is always available from
    <i>ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/</i> and
    <i>http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/snapshot/bash-master.tar.gz</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the
    <i>bashbug</i> command to submit a bug report. If you have a fix, you are
    encouraged to mail that as well! Suggestions and `philosophical' bug reports
    may be mailed to <i>bug-bash@gnu.org</i> or posted to the Usenet newsgroup
    <b>gnu.bash.bug</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">ALL bug reports should include:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

    <b>bash</b></a></dt>

<p class="Pp">It's too big and too slow.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are some subtle differences between <b>bash</b> and
    traditional versions of <b>sh</b>, mostly because of the
    <small><b>POSIX</b></small> specification.</p>
<p class="Pp">Aliases are confusing in some uses.</p>
<p class="Pp">Shell builtin commands and functions are not
    stoppable/restartable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c'
    are not handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted. When a
    process is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next command in the
    sequence. It suffices to place the sequence of commands between parentheses
    to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Array variables may not (yet) be exported.</p>
<p class="Pp">There may be only one active coprocess at a time.</p>
