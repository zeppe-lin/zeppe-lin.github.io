# Welcome to Zeppe-Lin {.unnumbered}

![Artwork for v1.1 — Featuring Stine Luft Satomi](https://github.com/zeppe-lin/artwork/blob/master/v1.1.png?raw=true)

## Introduction {.unnumbered}

**Minimal. Source-based. Built to be understood.**

Zeppe-Lin is a GNU/Linux distribution for x86-64 systems,
forked from [CRUX](https://crux.nu/) and forged in the spirit
of KISS - *Keep It Simple, Stupid*.

It is a system for those who prefer clarity over abstraction
and full control over their computing environment.

> You compile. You configure. You own it. You fix it when it breaks.

## Current Release {.unnumbered}

**Zeppe-Lin v1.1**  
Released August 1, 2025

This release focuses on toolchain alignment, documentation maturity,

> responsible for your compiler flags.
