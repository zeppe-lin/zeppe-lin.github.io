<p class="Pp"><b>fakeroot</b> runs a command in an environment wherein it
    appears to have root privileges for file manipulation. This is useful for
    allowing users to create archives (tar, ar, .deb etc.) with files in them
    with root permissions/ownership. Without <b>fakeroot</b> one would need to
    have root privileges to create the constituent files of the archives with
    the correct permissions and ownership, and then pack them up, or one would
    have to construct the archives directly, without using the archiver.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>fakeroot</b> works by replacing the file manipulation library
    functions (chmod(2), stat(2) etc.) by ones that simulate the effect the real
    library functions would have had, had the user really been root. These
    wrapper functions are in a shared library <b>/usr/lib/*/libfakeroot-*.so</b>
    or similar location on your platform. The shared object is loaded through
    the <b>LD_PRELOAD</b> mechanism of the dynamic loader. (See
  <b>ld.so</b>(8))</p>
<p class="Pp">If you intend to build packages with <b>fakeroot</b>, please try
    building the fakeroot package first: the &quot;debian/rules build&quot;
    stage has a few tests (testing mostly for bugs in old fakeroot versions). If
    those tests fail (for example because you have certain libc5 programs on
    your system), other packages you build with fakeroot will quite likely fail
    too, but possibly in much more subtle ways.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, note that it's best not to do the building of the binaries
    themselves under fakeroot. Especially configure and friends don't like it
    when the system suddenly behaves differently from what they expect. (or,
    they randomly unset some environment variables, some of which fakeroot
    needs).</p>

  <dd>Save the fakeroot environment to save-file on exit. This file can be used
      to restore the environment later using -i. However, this file will leak
      and fakeroot will behave in odd ways unless you leave the files touched
      inside the fakeroot alone when outside the environment. Still, this can be
      useful. For example, it can be used with rsync(1) to back up and restore
      whole directory trees complete with user, group and device information
      without needing to be root. See
      <i>/usr/share/doc/fakeroot/README.saving</i> for more details.</dd>

  <dd>Load a fakeroot environment previously saved using -s from load-file. Note
      that this does not implicitly save the file, use -s as well for that
      behaviour. Using the same file for both -i and -s in a single
      <b>fakeroot</b> invocation is safe.</dd>

  <dd>Fakeroot is implemented by wrapping system calls. This is accomplished by

      That library is loaded before the system's C library, and so most of the
      library functions are intercepted by it. If you need to set either
      <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> or <b>LD_PRELOAD</b> from within a fakeroot
      environment, it should be set relative to the given paths, as in

<span class="Li">fakeroot</span>

    <p class="Pp">fakeroot has no way of knowing that in the first case, the
        owner of foo really should be <b>joost</b> while the second case it
        should have been <b>root</b>. For the Debian packaging, defaulting to
        giving all &quot;unknown&quot; files uid=gid=0, is always OK. The real
        way around this is to wrap <b>open()</b> and <b>create()</b>, but that
        creates other problems, as demonstrated by the libtricks package. This
        package wrapped many more functions, and tried to do a lot more than
        <b>fakeroot .</b> It turned out that a minor upgrade of libc (from one
        where the <b>stat()</b> function didn't use <b>open()</b> to one with a
        <b>stat()</b> function that did (in some cases) use <b>open()</b>),
        would cause unexplainable segfaults (that is, the libc6 <b>stat()</b>
        called the wrapped <b>open()</b>, which would then call the libc6
        <b>stat()</b>, etc). Fixing them wasn't all that easy, but once fixed,
        it was just a matter of time before another function started to use
        open(), never mind trying to port it to a different operating system.
        Thus I decided to keep the number of functions wrapped by fakeroot as
        small as possible, to limit the likelihood of
        &#x2018;collisions&#x2019;.</p>

  <dt id="GNU"><a class="permalink" href="#GNU">GNU configure (and other such
    programs)</a></dt>
  <dd>fakeroot, in effect, is changing the way the system behaves. Programs that
      probe the system like GNU configure may get confused by this (or if they
      don't, they may stress fakeroot so much that fakeroot itself becomes
      confused). So, it's advisable not to run &quot;configure&quot; from within
      fakeroot. As configure should be called in the &quot;debian/rules
      build&quot; target, running &quot;dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot&quot;
      correctly takes care of this.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It doesn't wrap open(). This isn't bad by itself, but if a program
    does open(&quot;file&quot;, O_WRONLY, 000), writes to file &quot;file&quot;,
    closes it, and then again tries to open to read the file, then that open
    fails, as the mode of the file will be 000. The bug is that if root does the
    same, open() will succeed, as the file permissions aren't checked at all for
    root. I choose not to wrap open(), as open() is used by many other functions
    in libc (also those that are already wrapped), thus creating loops (or
    possible future loops, when the implementation of various libc functions
    slightly change).</p>
