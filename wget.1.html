<p class="Pp">GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files
    from the Web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as
    retrieval through HTTP proxies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the
    background, while the user is not logged on. This allows you to start a
    retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work. By
    contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence, which
    can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.</p>
<p class="Pp">Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create
    local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure
    of the original site. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;recursive
    downloading.&quot; While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion
    Standard (<i>/robots.txt</i>). Wget can be instructed to convert the links
    in downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable
    network connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
    keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved. If the server
    supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the download
    from where it left off.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Option_Syntax"><a class="permalink" href="#Option_Syntax">Option
  Syntax</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments,
    every option has a long form along with the short one. Long options are more
    convenient to remember, but take time to type. You may freely mix different
    option styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments. Thus you
    may write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The space between the option accepting an argument and the
    argument may be omitted. Instead of <b>-o log</b> you can write
    <b>-olog</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may put several options that do not require arguments
    together, like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        wget -drc &lt;URL&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is completely equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        wget -d -r -c &lt;URL&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
    terminate them with <b>--</b>. So the following will try to download URL
    <b>-x</b>, reporting failure to <i>log</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        wget -o log -- -x
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
    convention that specifying an empty list clears its value. This can be
    useful to clear the <i>.wgetrc</i> settings. For instance, if your
    <i>.wgetrc</i> sets <span class="Li">&quot;exclude_directories&quot;</span>
    to <i>/cgi-bin</i>, the following example will first reset it, and then set
    it to exclude <i>/~nobody</i> and <i>/~somebody</i>. You can also clear the
    lists in <i>.wgetrc</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        wget -X &quot;&quot; -X /~nobody,/~somebody
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Most options that do not accept arguments are <i>boolean</i>
    options, so named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no
    (&quot;boolean&quot;) variable. For example, <b>--follow-ftp</b> tells Wget
    to follow FTP links from HTML files and, on the other hand, <b>--no-glob</b>
    tells it not to perform file globbing on FTP URLs. A boolean option is
    either <i>affirmative</i> or <i>negative</i> (beginning with <b>--no</b>).
    All such options share several properties.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior
    is the opposite of what the option accomplishes. For example, the documented
    existence of <b>--follow-ftp</b> assumes that the default is to <i>not</i>
    follow FTP links from HTML pages.</p>
<p class="Pp">Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the <b>--no-</b>
    to the option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the
    <b>--no-</b> prefix. This might seem superfluous---if the default for an
    affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way to
    explicitly turn it off? But the startup file may in fact change the default.
    For instance, using <span class="Li">&quot;follow_ftp = on&quot;</span> in
    <i>.wgetrc</i> makes Wget <i>follow</i> FTP links by default, and using
    <b>--no-follow-ftp</b> is the only way to restore the factory default from
    the command line.</p>

        If <b>--force-html</b> is not specified, then <i>file</i> should consist
        of a series of URLs, one per line.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if you specify <b>--force-html</b>, the document will
        be regarded as <b>html</b>. In that case you may have problems with

      or when the input file was fetched remotely from a server describing it as

      <i>URL</i> as the value for the <span class="Li">&quot;href&quot;</span>
      attribute.

      as <i>file</i>, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling
      link conversion. (Use <b>./-</b> to print to a file literally named
      <b>-</b>.)
    <p class="Pp">Use of <b>-O</b> is <i>not</i> intended to mean simply
        &quot;use the name <i>file</i> instead of the one in the URL;&quot;
        rather, it is analogous to shell redirection: <b>wget -O file
        http://foo</b> is intended to work like <b>wget -O - http://foo &gt;
        file</b>; <i>file</i> will be truncated immediately, and <i>all</i>
        downloaded content will be written there.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For this reason, <b>-N</b> (for timestamp-checking) is not
        supported in combination with <b>-O</b>: since <i>file</i> is always
        newly created, it will always have a very new timestamp. A warning will
        be issued if this combination is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Similarly, using <b>-r</b> or <b>-p</b> with <b>-O</b> may not
        work as you expect: Wget won't just download the first file to
        <i>file</i> and then download the rest to their normal names: <i>all</i>
        downloaded content will be placed in <i>file</i>. This was disabled in
        version 1.11, but has been reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as
        there are some cases where this behavior can actually have some use.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A combination with <b>-nc</b> is only accepted if the given
        output file does not exist.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that a combination with <b>-k</b> is only permitted when
        downloading a single document, as in that case it will just convert all
        relative URIs to external ones; <b>-k</b> makes no sense for multiple
        URIs when they're all being downloaded to a single file; <b>-k</b> can

  <dd>If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget's
      behavior depends on a few options, including <b>-nc</b>. In certain cases,
      the local file will be <i>clobbered</i>, or overwritten, upon repeated
      download. In other cases it will be preserved.
    <p class="Pp">When running Wget without <b>-N</b>, <b>-nc</b>, <b>-r</b>, or
        <b>-p</b>, downloading the same file in the same directory will result
        in the original copy of <i>file</i> being preserved and the second copy
        being named <i>file</i><b>.1</b>. If that file is downloaded yet again,
        the third copy will be named <i>file</i><b>.2</b>, and so on. (This is
        also the behavior with <b>-nd</b>, even if <b>-r</b> or <b>-p</b> are in
        effect.) When <b>-nc</b> is specified, this behavior is suppressed, and
        Wget will refuse to download newer copies of <i>file</i>. Therefore,
        &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;no-clobber&quot;</span>&quot; is actually a
        misnomer in this mode---it's not clobbering that's prevented (as the
        numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but rather the
        multiple version saving that's prevented.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When running Wget with <b>-r</b> or <b>-p</b>, but without
        <b>-N</b>, <b>-nd</b>, or <b>-nc</b>, re-downloading a file will result
        in the new copy simply overwriting the old. Adding <b>-nc</b> will
        prevent this behavior, instead causing the original version to be
        preserved and any newer copies on the server to be ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When running Wget with <b>-N</b>, with or without <b>-r</b> or
        <b>-p</b>, the decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of
        a file depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file.
        <b>-nc</b> may not be specified at the same time as <b>-N</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A combination with <b>-O</b>/<b>--output-document</b> is only

    <p class="Pp">Note that when <b>-nc</b> is specified, files with the

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If there is a file named <i>ls-lR.Z</i> in the current
        directory, Wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote
        file, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset
        equal to the length of the local file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just
        want the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should
        the connection be lost midway through. This is the default behavior.
        <b>-c</b> only affects resumption of downloads started <i>prior</i> to
        this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting
      around.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Without <b>-c</b>, the previous example would just download
        the remote file to <i>ls-lR.Z.1</i>, leaving the truncated
        <i>ls-lR.Z</i> file alone.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you use <b>-c</b> on a non-empty file, and the server does
        not support continued downloading, Wget will restart the download from
        scratch and overwrite the existing file entirely.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <b>-c</b> on a file which
        is of equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download
        the file and print an explanatory message. The same happens when the
        file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was
        changed on the server since your last download attempt)---because
        &quot;continuing&quot; is not meaningful, no download occurs.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On the other side of the coin, while using <b>-c</b>, any file
        that's bigger on the server than locally will be considered an
        incomplete download and only <span class="Li">&quot;(length(remote) -
        length(local))&quot;</span> bytes will be downloaded and tacked onto the
        end of the local file. This behavior can be desirable in certain
        cases---for instance, you can use <b>wget -c</b> to download just the
        new portion that's been appended to a data collection or log file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
        <i>changed</i>, as opposed to just <i>appended</i> to, you'll end up
        with a garbled file. Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is
        really a valid prefix of the remote file. You need to be especially
        careful of this when using <b>-c</b> in conjunction with <b>-r</b>,
        since every file will be considered as an &quot;incomplete
        download&quot; candidate.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to
        use <b>-c</b> is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a
        &quot;transfer interrupted&quot; string into the local file. In the
        future a &quot;rollback&quot; option may be added to deal with this
        case.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <b>-c</b> only works with FTP servers and with HTTP
        servers that support the <span class="Li">&quot;Range&quot;</span>
        header.</p>

  <dt id="progress="><a class="permalink" href="#progress="><b>--progress=</b><i>type</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use. Legal
      indicators are &quot;dot&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">The &quot;bar&quot; indicator is used by default. It draws an
        ASCII progress bar graphics (a.k.a &quot;thermometer&quot; display)
        indicating the status of retrieval. If the output is not a TTY, the
        &quot;dot&quot; bar will be used by default.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Use <b>--progress=dot</b> to switch to the &quot;dot&quot;
        display. It traces the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each
        dot representing a fixed amount of downloaded data.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The progress <i>type</i> can also take one or more parameters.
        The parameters vary based on the <i>type</i> selected. Parameters to
        <i>type</i> are passed by appending them to the type sperated by a colon
        (:) like this:
        <b>--progress=</b><i>type</i><b>:</b><i>parameter1</i><b>:</b><i>parameter2</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When using the dotted retrieval, you may set the <i>style</i>
        by specifying the type as <b>dot:</b><i>style</i>. Different styles
        assign different meaning to one dot. With the
        <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> style each dot represents
        1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;binary&quot;</span> style has a more
        &quot;computer&quot;-like orientation---8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48
        dots per line (which makes for 384K lines). The
        <span class="Li">&quot;mega&quot;</span> style is suitable for
        downloading large files---each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are
        eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains
        3M). If <span class="Li">&quot;mega&quot;</span> is not enough then you
        can use the <span class="Li">&quot;giga&quot;</span> style---each dot
        represents 1M retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 32 dots
        on each line (so each line contains 32M).</p>
    <p class="Pp">With <b>--progress=bar</b>, there are currently two possible
        parameters, <i>force</i> and <i>noscroll</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When the output is not a TTY, the progress bar always falls
        back to &quot;dot&quot;, even if <b>--progress=bar</b> was passed to
        Wget during invocation. This behaviour can be overridden and the
        &quot;bar&quot; output forced by using the &quot;force&quot; parameter
        as <b>--progress=bar:force</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default, the <b>bar</b> style progress bar scroll the name
        of the file from left to right for the file being downloaded if the
        filename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display. In certain
        cases, such as with <b>--progress=bar:force</b>, one may not want the
        scrolling filename in the progress bar. By passing the
        &quot;noscroll&quot; parameter, Wget can be forced to display as much of
        the filename as possible without scrolling through it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that you can set the default style using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;progress&quot;</span> command in <i>.wgetrc</i>.
        That setting may be overridden from the command line. For example, to
        force the bar output without scrolling, use
        <b>--progress=bar:force:noscroll</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="show"><a class="permalink" href="#show"><b>--show-progress</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Force wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity.
    <p class="Pp">By default, wget only displays the progress bar in verbose
        mode. One may however, want wget to display the progress bar on screen
        in conjunction with any other verbosity modes like <b>--no-verbose</b>
        or <b>--quiet</b>. This is often a desired a property when invoking wget
        to download several small/large files. In such a case, wget could simply
        be invoked with this parameter to get a much cleaner output on the
        screen.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option will also force the progress bar to be printed to
        <i>stderr</i> when used alongside the <b>--output-file</b> option.</p>

        <b>--timestamping</b> on subsequent invocations of wget. However, it is
        sometimes useful to base the local file's timestamp on when it was

    <pre>        wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html

      specifying <b>--dns-timeout</b>, <b>--connect-timeout</b>, and
      <b>--read-timeout</b>, all at the same time.
    <p class="Pp">When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout
        and abort the operation if it takes too long. This prevents anomalies
        like hanging reads and infinite connects. The only timeout enabled by
        default is a 900-second read timeout. Setting a timeout to 0 disables it
        altogether. Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to change
        the default timeout settings.</p>
    <p class="Pp">All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
        subsecond values. For example, <b>0.1</b> seconds is a legal (though
        unwise) choice of timeout. Subsecond timeouts are useful for checking
        server response times or for testing network latency.</p>

  <dt id="connect"><a class="permalink" href="#connect"><b>--connect-timeout=</b><i>seconds</i></a></dt>

  <dd>Set the read (and write) timeout to <i>seconds</i> seconds. The

      number of seconds, reading fails and the download is restarted. This
      option does not directly affect the duration of the entire download.
    <p class="Pp">Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the
        connection sooner than this option requires. The default read timeout is
        900 seconds.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="limit"><a class="permalink" href="#limit"><b>--limit-rate=</b><i>amount</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Limit the download speed to <i>amount</i> bytes per second. Amount may be
      expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the <b>k</b> suffix, or megabytes with
      the <b>m</b> suffix. For example, <b>--limit-rate=20k</b> will limit the
      retrieval rate to 20KB/s. This is useful when, for whatever reason, you
      don't want Wget to consume the entire available bandwidth.
    <p class="Pp">This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in
        conjunction with power suffixes; for example, <b>--limit-rate=2.5k</b>
        is a legal value.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the
        appropriate amount of time after a network read that took less time than
        specified by the rate. Eventually this strategy causes the TCP transfer
        to slow down to approximately the specified rate. However, it may take
        some time for this balance to be achieved, so don't be surprised if
        limiting the rate doesn't work well with very small files.</p>

  <dd>Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals. Use of this
      option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by making the
      requests less frequent. Instead of in seconds, the time can be specified
      in minutes using the <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> suffix, in
      hours using <span class="Li">&quot;h&quot;</span> suffix, or in days using
      <span class="Li">&quot;d&quot;</span> suffix.
    <p class="Pp">Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the
        network or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long
        enough to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the
        retry. The waiting interval specified by this function is influenced by

  </dd>
  <dt id="waitretry="><a class="permalink" href="#waitretry="><b>--waitretry=</b><i>seconds</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If you don't want Wget to wait between <i>every</i> retrieval, but only
      between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option. Wget will
      use <i>linear backoff</i>, waiting 1 second after the first failure on a
      given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second failure on that file,
      up to the maximum number of <i>seconds</i> you specify.
    <p class="Pp">By default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="random"><a class="permalink" href="#random"><b>--random-wait</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval programs
      such as Wget by looking for statistically significant similarities in the
      time between requests. This option causes the time between requests to
      vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * <i>wait</i> seconds, where <i>wait</i> was
      specified using the <b>--wait</b> option, in order to mask Wget's presence
      from such analysis.
    <p class="Pp">A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a
        popular consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the
        fly. Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to
        ensure automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing
        DHCP-supplied addresses.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>--random-wait</b> option was inspired by this
        ill-advised recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site
        due to the actions of one.</p>

      megabytes (with <b>m</b> suffix).
    <p class="Pp">Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.
        So if you specify <b>wget -Q10k https://example.com/ls-lR.gz</b>, all of
        the <i>ls-lR.gz</i> will be downloaded. The same goes even when several
        URLs are specified on the command-line. The quota is checked only at the
        end of each downloaded file, so it will never result in a partially
        downloaded file. Thus you may safely type <b>wget -Q2m -i
        sites</b>---download will be aborted after the file that exhausts the
        quota is completely downloaded.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Setting quota to 0 or to <b>inf</b> unlimits the download

  <dt id="no~7"><a class="permalink" href="#no~7"><b>--no-dns-cache</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn off caching of DNS lookups. Normally, Wget remembers the IP addresses
      it looked up from DNS so it doesn't have to repeatedly contact the DNS
      server for the same (typically small) set of hosts it retrieves from. This
      cache exists in memory only; a new Wget run will contact DNS again.
    <p class="Pp">However, it has been reported that in some situations it is
        not desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a
        short-running application like Wget. With this option Wget issues a new
        DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to
        <span class="Li">&quot;gethostbyname&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;getaddrinfo&quot;</span>) each time it makes a
        new connection. Please note that this option will <i>not</i> affect
        caching that might be performed by the resolving library or by an
        external caching layer, such as NSCD.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you don't understand exactly what this option does, you
        probably won't need it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="restrict"><a class="permalink" href="#restrict"><b>--restrict-file-names=</b><i>modes</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped during
      generation of local filenames. Characters that are <i>restricted</i> by
      this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with
      <b></b><span class="Li"><b>%HH</b></span><b></b>, where <b>HH</b> is the
      hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted character. This
      option may also be used to force all alphabetical cases to be either
      lower- or uppercase.
    <p class="Pp">By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or
        safe as part of file names on your operating system, as well as control
        characters that are typically unprintable. This option is useful for
        changing these defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to a
        non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of the
        control characters, or you want to further restrict characters to only
        those in the ASCII range of values.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>modes</i> are a comma-separated set of text values. The
        acceptable values are <b>unix</b>, <b>windows</b>, <b>nocontrol</b>,
        <b>ascii</b>, <b>lowercase</b>, and <b>uppercase</b>. The values
        <b>unix</b> and <b>windows</b> are mutually exclusive (one will override
        the other), as are <b>lowercase</b> and <b>uppercase</b>. Those last are
        special cases, as they do not change the set of characters that would be
        escaped, but rather force local file paths to be converted either to
        lower- or uppercase.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When &quot;unix&quot; is specified, Wget escapes the character
        <b>/</b> and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.
        This is the default on Unix-like operating systems.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When &quot;windows&quot; is given, Wget escapes the characters
        <b>\</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>/</b>, <b>:</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>&quot;</b>,
        <b>*</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, and the control characters in the
        ranges 0--31 and 128--159. In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode
        uses <b>+</b> instead of <b>:</b> to separate host and port in local
        file names, and uses <b>@</b> instead of <b>?</b> to separate the query
        portion of the file name from the rest. Therefore, a URL that would be
        saved as <b>www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah</b> in Unix mode
        would be saved as <b>www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah</b> in
        Windows mode. This mode is the default on Windows.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you specify <b>nocontrol</b>, then the escaping of the
        control characters is also switched off. This option may make sense when
        you are downloading URLs whose names contain UTF-8 characters, on a
        system which can save and display filenames in UTF-8 (some possible byte
        values used in UTF-8 byte sequences fall in the range of values
        designated by Wget as &quot;controls&quot;).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>ascii</b> mode is used to specify that any bytes whose
        values are outside the range of ASCII characters (that is, greater than
        127) shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving filenames whose
        encoding does not match the one used locally.</p>

      Conversely, with <b>--inet6-only</b> or <b>-6</b>, Wget will only connect
      to IPv6 hosts and ignore A records and IPv4 addresses.
    <p class="Pp">Neither options should be needed normally. By default, an
        IPv6-aware Wget will use the address family specified by the host's DNS
        record. If the DNS responds with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, Wget will
        try them in sequence until it finds one it can connect to. (Also see
        <span class="Li">&quot;--prefer-family&quot;</span> option described
        below.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">These options can be used to deliberately force the use of
        IPv4 or IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually to aid
        debugging or to deal with broken network configuration. Only one of
        <b>--inet6-only</b> and <b>--inet4-only</b> may be specified at the same

        When the preferred family is <span class="Li">&quot;IPv4&quot;</span>,
        the IPv4 address is used first; when the preferred family is
        <span class="Li">&quot;IPv6&quot;</span>, the IPv6 address is used
        first; if the specified value is
        <span class="Li">&quot;none&quot;</span>, the address order returned by

        this option is <i>stable</i>---it doesn't affect order of addresses of

  <dd>Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving recursively. With
      this option turned on, all files will get saved to the current directory,

  <dd>The opposite of <b>-nd</b>---create a hierarchy of directories, even if
      one would not have been created otherwise. E.g. <b>wget -x</b>
      <b>http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt</b> will save the downloaded file to

  <dd>Disable generation of host-prefixed directories. By default, invoking Wget
      with <b>-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</b> will create a structure of
      directories beginning with <i>fly.srk.fer.hr/</i>. This option disables
      such behavior.</dd>
  <dt id="protocol"><a class="permalink" href="#protocol"><b>--protocol-directories</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file names. For
      example, with this option, <b>wget -r http://</b><i>host</i> will save to
      <b>http/</b><i>host</i><b>/...</b> rather than just to
      <i>host</i><b>/...</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="cut"><a class="permalink" href="#cut"><b>--cut-dirs=</b><i>number</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Ignore <i>number</i> directory components. This is useful for getting a
      fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval will be
      saved.
    <p class="Pp">Take, for example, the directory at
        <b>ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</b>. If you retrieve it with
        <b>-r</b>, it will be saved locally under
        <i>ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</i>. While the <b>-nH</b> option can
        remove the <i>ftp.xemacs.org/</i> part, you are still stuck with
        <i>pub/xemacs</i>. This is where <b>--cut-dirs</b> comes in handy; it
        makes Wget not &quot;see&quot; <i>number</i> remote directory
        components. Here are several examples of how <b>--cut-dirs</b> option
        works.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        No options        -&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
        -nH               -&gt; pub/xemacs/
        -nH --cut-dirs=1  -&gt; xemacs/
        -nH --cut-dirs=2  -&gt; .
        
        --cut-dirs=1      -&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
        ...
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this
        option is similar to a combination of <b>-nd</b> and <b>-P</b>. However,
        unlike <b>-nd</b>, <b>--cut-dirs</b> does not lose with
        subdirectories---for instance, with <b>-nH --cut-dirs=1</b>, a
        <i>beta/</i> subdirectory will be placed to <i>xemacs/beta</i>, as one
        would expect.</p>

  <dd>Set directory prefix to <i>prefix</i>. The <i>directory prefix</i> is the

  <dd>If a file of type <b>application/xhtml+xml</b> or <b>text/html</b> is
      downloaded and the URL does not end with the regexp
      <b>\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?</b>, this option will cause the suffix <b>.html</b>
      to be appended to the local filename. This is useful, for instance, when
      you're mirroring a remote site that uses <b>.asp</b> pages, but you want
      the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock Apache server. Another
      good use for this is when you're downloading CGI-generated materials. A
      URL like <b>http://site.com/article.cgi?25</b> will be saved as
      <i>article.cgi?25.html</i>.
    <p class="Pp">Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded
        every time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the local
        <i></i><i>X</i><i>.html</i> file corresponds to remote URL <i>X</i>
        (since it doesn't yet know that the URL produces output of type
        <b>text/html</b> or <b>application/xhtml+xml</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of version 1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded
        files of type <b>text/css</b> end in the suffix <b>.css</b>, and the
        option was renamed from <b>--html-extension</b>, to better reflect its
        new behavior. The old option name is still acceptable, but should now be
        considered deprecated.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of version 1.19.2, Wget will also ensure that any
        downloaded files with a
        <span class="Li">&quot;Content-Encoding&quot;</span> of <b>br</b>,
        <b>compress</b>, <b>deflate</b> or <b>gzip</b> end in the suffix
        <b>.br</b>, <b>.Z</b>, <b>.zlib</b> and <b>.gz</b> respectively.</p>
    <p class="Pp">At some point in the future, this option may well be expanded

  <dt id="http~2"><a class="permalink" href="#http~2"><b>--http-password=</b><i>password</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify the username <i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> on an HTTP
      server. According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them
      using either the <span class="Li">&quot;basic&quot;</span> (insecure), the
      <span class="Li">&quot;digest&quot;</span>, or the Windows
      <span class="Li">&quot;NTLM&quot;</span> authentication scheme.
    <p class="Pp">Another way to specify username and password is in the URL
        itself. Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run
        <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span>. To prevent the passwords from
        being seen, use the <b>--use-askpass</b> or store them in <i>.wgetrc</i>
        or <i>.netrc</i>, and make sure to protect those files from other users
        with <span class="Li">&quot;chmod&quot;</span>. If the passwords are
        really important, do not leave them lying in those files either---edit
        the files and delete them after Wget has started the download.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="no~11"><a class="permalink" href="#no~11"><b>--no-http-keep-alive</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn off the &quot;keep-alive&quot; feature for HTTP downloads. Normally,
      Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you
      download more than one document from the same server, they get transferred
      over the same TCP connection. This saves time and at the same time reduces
      the load on the server.
    <p class="Pp">This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent
        (keep-alive) connections don't work for you, for example due to a server
        bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the
        connections.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="no~12"><a class="permalink" href="#no~12"><b>--no-cache</b></a></dt>

      appropriate directives (<b>Cache-Control: no-cache</b> and <b>Pragma:
      no-cache</b>) to get the file from the remote service, rather than
      returning the cached version. This is especially useful for retrieving and
      flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.
    <p class="Pp">Caching is allowed by default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="no~13"><a class="permalink" href="#no~13"><b>--no-cookies</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Disable the use of cookies. Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining
      server-side state. The server sends the client a cookie using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;Set-Cookie&quot;</span> header, and the client
      responds with the same cookie upon further requests. Since cookies allow
      the server owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange this
      information, some consider them a breach of privacy. The default is to use
      cookies; however, <i>storing</i> cookies is not on by default.</dd>
  <dt id="load"><a class="permalink" href="#load"><b>--load-cookies</b>
    <i>file</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Load cookies from <i>file</i> before the first HTTP retrieval. <i>file</i>
      is a textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's
      <i>cookies.txt</i> file.
    <p class="Pp">You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that
        require that you be logged in to access some or all of their content.
        The login process typically works by the web server issuing an HTTP
        cookie upon receiving and verifying your credentials. The cookie is then
        resent by the browser when accessing that part of the site, and so
        proves your identity.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies
        your browser sends when communicating with the site. This is achieved by
        <b>--load-cookies</b>---simply point Wget to the location of the
        <i>cookies.txt</i> file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
        would send in the same situation. Different browsers keep textual cookie
        files in different locations:</p>

  <dd>Mozilla's cookie file is also named <i>cookies.txt</i>, located somewhere
      under <i>~/.mozilla</i>, in the directory of your profile. The full path

</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If you cannot use <b>--load-cookies</b>, there might still be an
    alternative. If your browser supports a &quot;cookie manager&quot;, you can
    use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you're mirroring.
    Write down the name and value of the cookie, and manually instruct Wget to
    send those cookies, bypassing the &quot;official&quot; cookie support:</p>

  <dt id="keep~2"><a class="permalink" href="#keep~2"><b>--keep-session-cookies</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When specified, causes <b>--save-cookies</b> to also save session cookies.
      Session cookies are normally not saved because they are meant to be kept
      in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser. Saving them is useful
      on sites that require you to log in or to visit the home page before you
      can access some pages. With this option, multiple Wget runs are considered
      a single browser session as far as the site is concerned.
    <p class="Pp">Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session
        cookies, Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0. Wget's
        <b>--load-cookies</b> recognizes those as session cookies, but it might
        confuse other browsers. Also note that cookies so loaded will be treated
        as other session cookies, which means that if you want
        <b>--save-cookies</b> to preserve them again, you must use
        <b>--keep-session-cookies</b> again.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="ignore"><a class="permalink" href="#ignore"><b>--ignore-length</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more precise) send
      out bogus <span class="Li">&quot;Content-Length&quot;</span> headers,
      which makes Wget go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.
      You can spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again
      and again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has
      closed on the very same byte.
    <p class="Pp">With this option, Wget will ignore the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Content-Length&quot;</span> header---as if it
        never existed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="header="><a class="permalink" href="#header="><b>--header=</b><i>header-line</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Send <i>header-line</i> along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP
      request. The supplied header is sent as-is, which means it must contain
      name and value separated by colon, and must not contain newlines.
    <p class="Pp">You may define more than one additional header by specifying
        <b>--header</b> more than once.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Specification of an empty string as the header value will
        clear all previous user-defined headers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers
        otherwise generated automatically. This example instructs Wget to
        connect to localhost, but to specify <b>foo.bar</b> in the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Host&quot;</span> header:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        wget --header=&quot;Host: foo.bar&quot; http://localhost/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of <b>--header</b>
        caused sending of duplicate headers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="compression="><a class="permalink" href="#compression="><b>--compression=</b><i>type</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Choose the type of compression to be used. Legal values are <b>auto</b>,
      <b>gzip</b> and <b>none</b>.
    <p class="Pp">If <b>auto</b> or <b>gzip</b> are specified, Wget asks the
        server to compress the file using the gzip compression format. If the
        server compresses the file and responds with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Content-Encoding&quot;</span> header field set
        appropriately, the file will be decompressed automatically.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <b>none</b> is specified, wget will not ask the server to

    <p class="Pp">The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves
        using a <span class="Li">&quot;User-Agent&quot;</span> header field.
        This enables distinguishing the WWW software, usually for statistical
        purposes or for tracing of protocol violations. Wget normally identifies
        as <b>Wget/</b><i>version</i>, <i>version</i> being the current version
        number of Wget.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of
        tailoring the output according to the
        <span class="Li">&quot;User-Agent&quot;</span>-supplied information.
        While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has been abused by

  <dd>Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the specified data
      in the request body. <b>--post-data</b> sends <i>string</i> as data,
      whereas <b>--post-file</b> sends the contents of <i>file</i>. Other than
      that, they work in exactly the same way. In particular, they <i>both</i>
      expect content of the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;key1=value1&amp;key2=value2&quot;</span>, with
      percent-encoding for special characters; the only difference is that one
      expects its content as a command-line parameter and the other accepts its
      content from a file. In particular, <b>--post-file</b> is <i>not</i> for
      transmitting files as form attachments: those must appear as
      <span class="Li">&quot;key=value&quot;</span> data (with appropriate
      percent-coding) just like everything else. Wget does not currently support
      <span class="Li">&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;</span> for transmitting
      POST data; only
      <span class="Li">&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;</span>.
      Only one of <b>--post-data</b> and <b>--post-file</b> should be specified.
    <p class="Pp">Please note that wget does not require the content to be of
        the form
        <span class="Li">&quot;key1=value1&amp;key2=value2&quot;</span>, and
        neither does it test for it. Wget will simply transmit whatever data is
        provided to it. Most servers however expect the POST data to be in the
        above format when processing HTML Forms.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When sending a POST request using the <b>--post-file</b>
        option, Wget treats the file as a binary file and will send every
        character in the POST request without stripping trailing newline or
        formfeed characters. Any other control characters in the text will also
        be sent as-is in the POST request.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the POST
        data in advance. Therefore the argument to
        <span class="Li">&quot;--post-file&quot;</span> must be a regular file;
        specifying a FIFO or something like <i>/dev/stdin</i> won't work. It's
        not quite clear how to work around this limitation inherent in HTTP/1.0.
        Although HTTP/1.1 introduces <i>chunked</i> transfer that doesn't
        require knowing the request length in advance, a client can't use
        chunked unless it knows it's talking to an HTTP/1.1 server. And it can't
        know that until it receives a response, which in turn requires the
        request to have been completed -- a chicken-and-egg problem.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: As of version 1.15 if Wget is redirected after the POST
        request is completed, its behaviour will depend on the response code
        returned by the server. In case of a 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Moved
        Temporarily or 307 Temporary Redirect, Wget will, in accordance with
        RFC2616, continue to send a POST request. In case a server wants the
        client to change the Request method upon redirection, it should send a
        303 See Other response code.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This example shows how to log in to a server using POST and
        then proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only accessible
        to authorized users:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        # Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.
        wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \
             --post-data 'user=foo&amp;password=bar' \
             http://example.com/auth.php
        
        # Now grab the page or pages we care about.
        wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
             -p http://example.com/interesting/article.php
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the server is using session cookies to track user
        authentication, the above will not work because <b>--save-cookies</b>
        will not save them (and neither will browsers) and the
        <i>cookies.txt</i> file will be empty. In that case use
        <b>--keep-session-cookies</b> along with <b>--save-cookies</b> to force
        saving of session cookies.</p>

  <dt id="method="><a class="permalink" href="#method="><b>--method=</b><i>HTTP-Method</i></a></dt>
  <dd>For the purpose of RESTful scripting, Wget allows sending of other HTTP

      <i>file</i>. Other than that, they work in exactly the same way.
    <p class="Pp">Currently, <b>--body-file</b> is <i>not</i> for transmitting

        data; only
        <span class="Li">&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;</span>.
        In the future, this may be changed so that wget sends the
        <b>--body-file</b> as a complete file instead of sending its contents to
        the server. Please be aware that Wget needs to know the contents of BODY
        Data in advance, and hence the argument to <b>--body-file</b> should be
        a regular file. See <b>--post-file</b> for a more detailed explanation.
        Only one of <b>--body-data</b> and <b>--body-file</b> should be
        specified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If Wget is redirected after the request is completed, Wget
        will suspend the current method and send a GET request till the
        redirection is completed. This is true for all redirection response
        codes except 307 Temporary Redirect which is used to explicitly specify
        that the request method should <i>not</i> change. Another exception is
        when the method is set to <span class="Li">&quot;POST&quot;</span>, in

<h2 class="Ss">HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options</h2>
<p class="Pp">To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be compiled
    with an external SSL library. The current default is GnuTLS. In addition,
    Wget also supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security). If Wget is
    compiled without SSL support, none of these options are available.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="secure"><a class="permalink" href="#secure"><b>--secure-protocol=</b><i>protocol</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Choose the secure protocol to be used. Legal values are <b>auto</b>,
      <b>SSLv2</b>, <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1_1</b>, <b>TLSv1_2</b>,
      <b>TLSv1_3</b> and <b>PFS</b>. If <b>auto</b> is used, the SSL library is
      given the liberty of choosing the appropriate protocol automatically,
      which is achieved by sending a TLSv1 greeting. This is the default.
    <p class="Pp">Specifying <b>SSLv2</b>, <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>,
        <b>TLSv1_1</b>, <b>TLSv1_2</b> or <b>TLSv1_3</b> forces the use of the
        corresponding protocol. This is useful when talking to old and buggy SSL
        server implementations that make it hard for the underlying SSL library
        to choose the correct protocol version. Fortunately, such servers are
        quite rare.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Specifying <b>PFS</b> enforces the use of the so-called
        Perfect Forward Security cipher suites. In short, PFS adds security by
        creating a one-time key for each SSL connection. It has a bit more CPU
        impact on client and server. We use known to be secure ciphers (e.g. no
        MD4) and the TLS protocol. This mode also explicitly excludes non-PFS
        key exchange methods, such as RSA.</p>

  <dd>Set the cipher list string. Typically this string sets the cipher suites

  <dt id="no~14"><a class="permalink" href="#no~14"><b>--no-check-certificate</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Don't check the server certificate against the available certificate
      authorities. Also don't require the URL host name to match the common name
      presented by the certificate.
    <p class="Pp">As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server's
        certificate against the recognized certificate authorities, breaking the
        SSL handshake and aborting the download if the verification fails.
        Although this provides more secure downloads, it does break
        interoperability with some sites that worked with previous Wget
        versions, particularly those using self-signed, expired, or otherwise
        invalid certificates. This option forces an &quot;insecure&quot; mode of
        operation that turns the certificate verification errors into warnings
        and allows you to proceed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you encounter &quot;certificate verification&quot; errors
        or ones saying that &quot;common name doesn't match requested host
        name&quot;, you can use this option to bypass the verification and
        proceed with the download. <i>Only use this option if you are otherwise
        convinced of the</i> <i>site's authenticity, or if you really don't care
        about the validity of</i> <i>its certificate.</i> It is almost always a
        bad idea not to check the certificates when transmitting confidential or
        important data. For self-signed/internal certificates, you should
        download the certificate and verify against that instead of forcing this
        insecure mode. If you are really sure of not desiring any certificate
        verification, you can specify --check-certificate=quiet to tell wget to
        not print any warning about invalid certificates, albeit in most cases
        this is the wrong thing to do.</p>

      Use <b>--no-hsts</b> to make Wget act as a non-HSTS-compliant UA. As a
      consequence, Wget would ignore all the
      <span class="Li">&quot;Strict-Transport-Security&quot;</span> headers, and
      would not enforce any existing HSTS policy.</dd>
  <dt id="hsts"><a class="permalink" href="#hsts"><b>--hsts-file=</b><i>file</i></a></dt>
  <dd>By default, Wget stores its HSTS database in <i>~/.wget-hsts</i>. You can
      use <b>--hsts-file</b> to override this. Wget will use the supplied file
      as the HSTS database. Such file must conform to the correct HSTS database
      format used by Wget. If Wget cannot parse the provided file, the behaviour
      is unspecified.
    <p class="Pp">The Wget's HSTS database is a plain text file. Each line
        contains an HSTS entry (ie. a site that has issued a
        <span class="Li">&quot;Strict-Transport-Security&quot;</span> header and
        that therefore has specified a concrete HSTS policy to be applied).
        Lines starting with a dash (<span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span>) are
        ignored by Wget. Please note that in spite of this convenient
        human-readability hand-hacking the HSTS database is generally not a good
        idea.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An HSTS entry line consists of several fields separated by one
        or more whitespace:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;&lt;hostname&gt; SP [&lt;port&gt;] SP
        &lt;include subdomains&gt; SP &lt;created&gt; SP
        &lt;max-age&gt;&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>hostname</i> and <i>port</i> fields indicate the
        hostname and port to which the given HSTS policy applies. The
        <i>port</i> field may be zero, and it will, in most of the cases. That
        means that the port number will not be taken into account when deciding
        whether such HSTS policy should be applied on a given request (only the
        hostname will be evaluated). When <i>port</i> is different to zero, both
        the target hostname and the port will be evaluated and the HSTS policy
        will only be applied if both of them match. This feature has been
        included for testing/development purposes only. The Wget testsuite (in
        <i>testenv/</i>) creates HSTS databases with explicit ports with the
        purpose of ensuring Wget's correct behaviour. Applying HSTS policies to
        ports other than the default ones is discouraged by RFC 6797 (see
        Appendix B &quot;Differences between HSTS Policy and Same-Origin
        Policy&quot;). Thus, this functionality should not be used in production
        environments and <i>port</i> will typically be zero. The last three
        fields do what they are expected to. The field <i>include_subdomains</i>
        can either be <span class="Li">1</span> or <span class="Li">0</span> and
        it signals whether the subdomains of the target domain should be part of
        the given HSTS policy as well. The <i>created</i> and <i>max-age</i>
        fields hold the timestamp values of when such entry was created (first
        seen by Wget) and the HSTS-defined value 'max-age', which states how
        long should that HSTS policy remain active, measured in seconds elapsed
        since the timestamp stored in <i>created</i>. Once that time has passed,
        that HSTS policy will no longer be valid and will eventually be removed
        from the database.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you supply your own HSTS database via <b>--hsts-file</b>,
        be aware that Wget may modify the provided file if any change occurs
        between the HSTS policies requested by the remote servers and those in
        the file. When Wget exits, it effectively updates the HSTS database by
        rewriting the database file with the new entries.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the supplied file does not exist, Wget will create one.
        This file will contain the new HSTS entries. If no HSTS entries were

        were sent by any of the servers) then no file will be created, not even
        an empty one. This behaviour applies to the default database file
        (<i>~/.wget-hsts</i>) as well: it will not be created until some server
        enforces an HSTS policy.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Care is taken not to override possible changes made by other
        Wget processes at the same time over the HSTS database. Before dumping
        the updated HSTS entries on the file, Wget will re-read it and merge the
        changes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using a custom HSTS database and/or modifying an existing one
        is discouraged. For more information about the potential security
        threats arose from such practice, see section 14 &quot;Security

  <dt id="ftp~2"><a class="permalink" href="#ftp~2"><b>--ftp-password=</b><i>password</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify the username <i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> on an FTP
      server. Without this, or the corresponding startup option, the password
      defaults to <b>-wget@</b>, normally used for anonymous FTP.
    <p class="Pp">Another way to specify username and password is in the URL
        itself. Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run
        <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span>. To prevent the passwords from
        being seen, store them in <i>.wgetrc</i> or <i>.netrc</i>, and make sure
        to protect those files from other users with
        <span class="Li">&quot;chmod&quot;</span>. If the passwords are really
        important, do not leave them lying in those files either---edit the

  </dd>
  <dt id="no~19"><a class="permalink" href="#no~19"><b>--no-remove-listing</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Don't remove the temporary <i>.listing</i> files generated by FTP
      retrievals. Normally, these files contain the raw directory listings
      received from FTP servers. Not removing them can be useful for debugging
      purposes, or when you want to be able to easily check on the contents of
      remote server directories (e.g. to verify that a mirror you're running is
      complete).
    <p class="Pp">Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this
        file, this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
        <i>.listing</i> a symbolic link to <i>/etc/passwd</i> or something and
        asking <span class="Li">&quot;root&quot;</span> to run Wget in his or
        her directory. Depending on the options used, either Wget will refuse to
        write to <i>.listing</i>, making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping
        operation fail, or the symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with
        the actual <i>.listing</i> file, or the listing will be written to a
        <i>.listing.</i><i>number</i><i></i> file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Even though this situation isn't a problem, though,
        <span class="Li">&quot;root&quot;</span> should never run Wget in a
        non-trusted user's directory. A user could do something as simple as
        linking <i>index.html</i> to <i>/etc/passwd</i> and asking
        <span class="Li">&quot;root&quot;</span> to run Wget with <b>-N</b> or
        <b>-r</b> so the file will be overwritten.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="no~20"><a class="permalink" href="#no~20"><b>--no-glob</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn off FTP globbing. Globbing refers to the use of shell-like special
      characters (<i>wildcards</i>), like <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>[</b> and
      <b>]</b> to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once,
      like:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
        globbing character. This option may be used to turn globbing on or off
        permanently.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being
        expanded by your shell. Globbing makes Wget look for a directory
        listing, which is system-specific. This is why it currently works only
        with Unix FTP servers (and the ones emulating Unix
        <span class="Li">&quot;ls&quot;</span> output).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="no~21"><a class="permalink" href="#no~21"><b>--no-passive-ftp</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Disable the use of the <i>passive</i> FTP transfer mode. Passive FTP
      mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the data
      connection rather than the other way around.
    <p class="Pp">If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both
        passive and active FTP should work equally well. Behind most firewall
        and NAT configurations passive FTP has a better chance of working.
        However, in some rare firewall configurations, active FTP actually works
        when passive FTP doesn't. If you suspect this to be the case, use this
        option, or set <span class="Li">&quot;passive_ftp=off&quot;</span> in
        your init file.</p>

  <dt id="retr"><a class="permalink" href="#retr"><b>--retr-symlinks</b></a></dt>
  <dd>By default, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a symbolic
      link is encountered, the symbolic link is traversed and the pointed-to
      files are retrieved. Currently, Wget does not traverse symbolic links to
      directories to download them recursively, though this feature may be added
      in the future.
    <p class="Pp">When <b>--retr-symlinks=no</b> is specified, the linked-to
        file is not downloaded. Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on
        the local filesystem. The pointed-to file will not be retrieved unless
        this recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and
        downloaded it anyway. This option poses a security risk where a
        malicious FTP Server may cause Wget to write to files outside of the
        intended directories through a specially crafted .LISTING file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it
        was specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed
        to, this option has no effect. Symbolic links are always traversed in
        this case.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>This option tells Wget to use FTPS implicitly. Implicit FTPS consists of
      initializing SSL/TLS from the very beginning of the control connection.
      This option does not send an <span class="Li">&quot;AUTH TLS&quot;</span>
      command: it assumes the server speaks FTPS and directly starts an SSL/TLS
      connection. If the attempt is successful, the session continues just like
      regular FTPS (<span class="Li">&quot;PBSZ&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;PROT&quot;</span> are sent, etc.). Implicit FTPS is
      no longer a requirement for FTPS implementations, and thus many servers
      may not support it. If <b>--ftps-implicit</b> is passed and no explicit
      port number specified, the default port for implicit FTPS, 990, will be
      used, instead of the default port for the &quot;normal&quot; (explicit)
      FTPS which is the same as that of FTP, 21.</dd>
  <dt id="no~22"><a class="permalink" href="#no~22"><b>--no-ftps-resume-ssl</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not resume the SSL/TLS session in the data channel. When starting a
      data connection, Wget tries to resume the SSL/TLS session previously
      started in the control connection. SSL/TLS session resumption avoids
      performing an entirely new handshake by reusing the SSL/TLS parameters of
      a previous session. Typically, the FTPS servers want it that way, so Wget
      does this by default. Under rare circumstances however, one might want to
      start an entirely new SSL/TLS session in every data connection. This is
      what <b>--no-ftps-resume-ssl</b> is for.</dd>
  <dt id="ftps~2"><a class="permalink" href="#ftps~2"><b>--ftps-clear-data-connection</b></a></dt>

  <dt id="ftps~3"><a class="permalink" href="#ftps~3"><b>--ftps-fallback-to-ftp</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Fall back to FTP if FTPS is not supported by the target server. For

      behaviour is to exit with an error. If a server does not successfully
      reply to the initial <span class="Li">&quot;AUTH TLS&quot;</span> command,
      or in the case of implicit FTPS, if the initial SSL/TLS connection attempt
      is rejected, it is considered that such server does not support FTPS.</dd>

      the provided URL. Set <b>-l 0</b> or <b>-l inf</b> for infinite recursion
      depth.

    <p class="Pp">Ideally, one would expect this to download just <i>1.html</i>.
        but unfortunately this is not the case, because <b>-l 0</b> is
        equivalent to <b>-l inf</b>---that is, infinite recursion. To download a
        single HTML page (or a handful of them), specify them all on the command
        line and leave away <b>-r</b> and <b>-l</b>. To download the essential

  <dt id="delete"><a class="permalink" href="#delete"><b>--delete-after</b></a></dt>

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed to
      refer to the file they point to as a relative link.

        <i>/bar/img.gif</i>, also downloaded, then the link in <i>doc.html</i>
        will be modified to point to <b>../bar/img.gif</b>. This kind of
        transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of
      directories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed
      to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to.

  </li>
</ul>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file

    presenting a broken link. The fact that the former links are converted to
    relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to another

      images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.
    <p class="Pp">Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite
        documents that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded.
        Using <b>-r</b> together with <b>-l</b> can help, but since Wget does
        not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one
        is generally left with &quot;leaf documents&quot; that are missing their
        requisites.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For instance, say document <i>1.html</i> contains an

        <i>1.gif</i> and an <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;A&gt;&quot;</span> tag
        pointing to external document <i>2.html</i>. Say that <i>2.html</i> is
        similar but that its image is <i>2.gif</i> and it links to
        <i>3.html</i>. Say this continues up to some arbitrarily high
      number.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If one executes the command:</p>

    <p class="Pp">then <i>1.html</i>, <i>1.gif</i>, <i>2.html</i>, <i>2.gif</i>,
        and <i>3.html</i> will be downloaded. As you can see, <i>3.html</i> is
        without its requisite <i>3.gif</i> because Wget is simply counting the
        number of hops (up to 2) away from <i>1.html</i> in order to determine
        where to stop the recursion. However, with this command:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>

    <p class="Pp">all the above files <i>and</i> <i>3.html</i>'s requisite

    <pre>        wget -r -l 1 -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will cause <i>1.html</i>, <i>1.gif</i>, <i>2.html</i>, and

    <pre>        wget -r -l 0 -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would download just <i>1.html</i> and <i>1.gif</i>, but
        unfortunately this is not the case, because <b>-l 0</b> is equivalent to
        <b>-l inf</b>---that is, infinite recursion. To download a single HTML
        page (or a handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a
        <b>-i</b> URL input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave
        off <b>-r</b> and <b>-l</b>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        wget -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that Wget will behave as if <b>-r</b> had been specified,
        but only that single page and its requisites will be downloaded. Links
        from that page to external documents will not be followed. Actually, to
        download a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on
        separate websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally,
        this author likes to use a few options in addition to <b>-p</b>:</p>

    <pre>        wget -E -H -k -K -p http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea
        of an external document link is any URL specified in an
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;A&gt;&quot;</span> tag, an
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;AREA&gt;&quot;</span> tag, or a

  </dd>
  <dt id="strict"><a class="permalink" href="#strict"><b>--strict-comments</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn on strict parsing of HTML comments. The default is to terminate
      comments at the first occurrence of <b>--&gt;</b>.
    <p class="Pp">According to specifications, HTML comments are expressed as
        SGML <i>declarations</i>. Declaration is special markup that begins with
        <b>&lt;!</b> and ends with <b>&gt;</b>, such as <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE
        ...&gt;</b>, that may contain comments between a pair of <b>--</b>
        delimiters. HTML comments are &quot;empty declarations&quot;, SGML
        declarations without any non-comment text. Therefore,
        <b>&lt;!--foo--&gt;</b> is a valid comment, and so is <b>&lt;!--one--
        --two--&gt;</b>, but <b>&lt;!--1--2--&gt;</b> is not.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On the other hand, most HTML writers don't perceive comments
        as anything other than text delimited with <b>&lt;!--</b> and
        <b>--&gt;</b>, which is not quite the same. For example, something like
        <b>&lt;!------------&gt;</b> works as a valid comment as long as the
        number of dashes is a multiple of four (!). If not, the comment
        technically lasts until the next <b>--</b>, which may be at the other
        end of the document. Because of this, many popular browsers completely
        ignore the specification and implement what users have come to expect:
        comments delimited with <b>&lt;!--</b> and <b>--&gt;</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which
        resulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in
        browsers, but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant comments.
        Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of clients that
        implements &quot;naive&quot; comments, terminating each comment at the
        first occurrence of <b>--&gt;</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use
        this option to turn it on.</p>

      <b>?</b>, <b>[</b> or <b>]</b>, appear in an element of <i>acclist</i> or
      <i>rejlist</i>, it will be treated as a pattern, rather than a suffix. In
      this case, you have to enclose the pattern into quotes to prevent your

  <dd>Specify the regular expression type. Possible types are <b>posix</b> or

      compiled with libpcre support.</dd>

  <dt id="exclude"><a class="permalink" href="#exclude"><b>--exclude-domains</b>

  <dd>Specify the domains that are <i>not</i> to be followed.</dd>
  <dt id="follow"><a class="permalink" href="#follow"><b>--follow-ftp</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Follow FTP links from HTML documents. Without this option, Wget will
      ignore all the FTP links.</dd>
  <dt id="follow~2"><a class="permalink" href="#follow~2"><b>--follow-tags=</b><i>list</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs that it considers
      when looking for linked documents during a recursive retrieval. If a user
      wants only a subset of those tags to be considered, however, he or she
      should be specify such tags in a comma-separated <i>list</i> with this
      option.</dd>
  <dt id="ignore~2"><a class="permalink" href="#ignore~2"><b>--ignore-tags=</b><i>list</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This is the opposite of the <b>--follow-tags</b> option. To skip certain
      HTML tags when recursively looking for documents to download, specify them
      in a comma-separated <i>list</i>.
    <p class="Pp">In the past, this option was the best bet for downloading a
        single page and its requisites, using a command-line like:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        wget --ignore-tags=a,area -H -k -K -r http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">However, the author of this option came across a page with
        tags like <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;LINK REL=&quot;home&quot;
        HREF=&quot;/&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> and came to the realization that
        specifying tags to ignore was not enough. One can't just tell Wget to
        ignore <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;LINK&gt;&quot;</span>, because then
        stylesheets will not be downloaded. Now the best bet for downloading a
        single page and its requisites is the dedicated <b>--page-requisites</b>
        option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="ignore~3"><a class="permalink" href="#ignore~3"><b>--ignore-case</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Ignore case when matching files and directories. This influences the
      behavior of -R, -A, -I, and -X options, as well as globbing implemented
      when downloading from FTP sites. For example, with this option, <b>-A
      &quot;*.txt&quot;</b> will match <b>file1.txt</b>, but also
      <b>file2.TXT</b>, <b>file3.TxT</b>, and so on. The quotes in the example
      are to prevent the shell from expanding the pattern.</dd>
  <dt id="H"><a class="permalink" href="#H"><b>-H</b></a></dt>

<p class="Pp">Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals. The
    standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is using the
    following environment variables:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="http_proxy"><a class="permalink" href="#http_proxy"><b>http_proxy</b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="https_proxy"><a class="permalink" href="#https_proxy"><b>https_proxy</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If set, the <b>http_proxy</b> and <b>https_proxy</b> variables should
      contain the URLs of the proxies for HTTP and HTTPS connections
      respectively.</dd>
  <dt id="ftp_proxy"><a class="permalink" href="#ftp_proxy"><b>ftp_proxy</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for FTP connections. It
      is quite common that <b>http_proxy</b> and <b>ftp_proxy</b> are set to the
      same URL.</dd>
  <dt id="no_proxy"><a class="permalink" href="#no_proxy"><b>no_proxy</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain extensions
      proxy should <i>not</i> be used for. For instance, if the value of
      <b>no_proxy</b> is <b>.mit.edu</b>, proxy will not be used to retrieve
      documents from MIT.</dd>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Wget may return one of several error codes if it encounters
    problems.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>0</dt>
  <dd>No problems occurred.</dd>
  <dt>1</dt>
  <dd>Generic error code.</dd>
  <dt>2</dt>
  <dd>Parse error---for instance, when parsing command-line options, the
      <b>.wgetrc</b> or <b>.netrc</b>...</dd>
  <dt>3</dt>
  <dd>File I/O error.</dd>
  <dt>4</dt>
  <dd>Network failure.</dd>
  <dt>5</dt>
  <dd>SSL verification failure.</dd>
  <dt>6</dt>
  <dd>Username/password authentication failure.</dd>
  <dt>7</dt>
  <dd>Protocol errors.</dd>
  <dt>8</dt>
  <dd>Server issued an error response.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">With the exceptions of 0 and 1, the lower-numbered exit codes take
    precedence over higher-numbered ones, when multiple types of errors are
    encountered.</p>
<p class="Pp">In versions of Wget prior to 1.12, Wget's exit status tended to be
    unhelpful and inconsistent. Recursive downloads would virtually always
    return 0 (success), regardless of any issues encountered, and non-recursive
    fetches only returned the status corresponding to the most
    recently-attempted download.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You are welcome to submit bug reports via the GNU Wget bug tracker
    (see
    &lt;<b>https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=additem&amp;group=wget</b>&gt;)
    or to our mailing list &lt;<b>bug-wget@gnu.org</b>&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Visit
    &lt;<b>https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget</b>&gt; to get more
    info (how to subscribe, list archives, ...).</p>
<p class="Pp">Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a
    few simple guidelines.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug. If Wget
      crashes, it's a bug. If Wget does not behave as documented, it's a bug. If
      things work strange, but you are not sure about the way they are supposed
      to work, it might well be a bug, but you might want to double-check the
      documentation and the mailing lists.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible. E.g. if Wget
      crashes while downloading <b>wget -rl0 -kKE -t5 --no-proxy</b>
      <b>http://example.com -o /tmp/log</b>, you should try to see if the crash
      is repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of options. You might
      even try to start the download at the page where the crash occurred to see
      if that page somehow triggered the crash.
    <p class="Pp">Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents
        of your <i>.wgetrc</i> file, just dumping it into the debug message is
        probably a bad idea. Instead, you should first try to see if the bug
        repeats with <i>.wgetrc</i> moved out of the way. Only if it turns out
        that <i>.wgetrc</i> settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant parts
        of the file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Please start Wget with <b>-d</b> option and send us the resulting output
      (or relevant parts thereof). If Wget was compiled without debug support,
      recompile it---it is <i>much</i> easier to trace bugs with debug support
      on.
    <p class="Pp">Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive
        information from the debug log before sending it to the bug address. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;-d&quot;</span> won't go out of its way to
        collect sensitive information, but the log <i>will</i> contain a fairly
        complete transcript of Wget's communication with the server, which may
        include passwords and pieces of downloaded data. Since the bug address
        is publicly archived, you may assume that all bug reports are visible to
        the public.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;gdb `which</span> <span class="Li">wget`
      core&quot;</span> and type <span class="Li">&quot;where&quot;</span> to
      get the backtrace. This may not work if the system administrator has
      disabled core files, but it is safe to try.</dd>
